Text Tool
=========

|tooltext|

This tool allows you to add text to your artwork.

You use it by doing |mouseleft| + drag to create a rectangular selection. When releasing |mouseleft| a default text will be created and the text editor window will pop-up.

Hovering over other text shapes will highlight their bounding box. |mouseleft| on a highlighted text will select it as the active text.

Tool Options
------------

Create new texts with...
    This contains features with which to create new texts, the following items are available:

    Font
        The letter type used by newly created texts.
    Size in pt
        The letter-size used by newly created texts. It is in pts(points), which is a common standard for fonts that is measured 72 points per inch. It therefore will stay proportionally the same size if you increase or decrease canvas dpi.
    Anchor/Align text to the left/middle/right
        Text alignment. This allows you to align text to the left, center it, or to the right. This is called text-anchor because svg 1.1's multiline text only uses text-anchor, and this is a slight bit different than text-align(And also the reason justify isn't available at the moment).
Edit Text
    This will summon the text editor for the currently selected shape. This can be quickly invoked with either pressing :kbd:`Enter` or Double - |mouseleft| the shape.

Text Editor
-----------

A small window for all your text editing needs. The Text Editor has two tabs: Rich text and SVG source.

Activating

    You can use the Text tool to first create a text box. There are a few options in the tool options if you want to customize how the text will be adding. You will need to drag a rectangle on the canvas to create the text area. There is no word wrapping, so for now the box you draw will not have an effect on the results. Once your text is created, you can edit the text from two ways:
    
    #. Select the text with the shape selection tool (first tool). Press the Enter key. The text editor will appear.
    #. Select the text with the shape selection tool (first tool). Then click the Text tool. In the tool options there is an "Edit Text" button. When you click that the text editor window will appear. 

Editing
    If you are unfamiliar with the way svg text works, use the rich text tab, it will allow you to edit the text as you see it, at the cost of not having all functionality.

If you are a little bit more familiar with svg text, you can directly edit the SVG source. Do note that certain things, like stroke, fill, letter-spacing don't convert back to the rich text editor, so do be careful when switching back.

Press 'save' as you're done with your edits to preview them on canvas.

Settings

        Calls up the text-editor settings dialog.

Text Editor Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The settings that can be configured for the text editor.

Editor Mode
    Whether you want both the Rich Text Editor and the SVG Source Editor, or only one of either.
Colors
    Here you can configure the syntax highlighting for the SVG source.

    Keyword
        These highlights important characters like <, /, and >
    Element
        The format for highlighting the element tag name. **text** and **tspan** are examples of element names.
    Attribute
        The format for highlighting theAttributes of the tag. For example, font-family, when it isn't in the style tag is usually written as an attribute.
    Value
        The format for highlighting value of attributes.
    Comment
        This highlights xml comments, which are written as following: ``<!-- This is an xml comment -->``. Comments are pieces of text that never get interpreted.
    Editor Text Color
        The main color of the editor.
    Editor background color
        The main background color of the editor.

Fonts
    This allows you to filter the selection of fonts in the editor by writing system. Some systems have a lot of fonts specifically for showing foreign languages properly, but these might not be useful for you. You just tick the writing systems which you use yourself, and the font dropdown will only show fonts that have full support for that language.

Fine typographic control with the SVG Source tab
------------------------------------------------

So, the rich text editor cannot control all functionality that SVG text allows for. For that, you will need to touch the SVG source directly. But to do that, you will first need to go to the text editor settings and enable either :guilabel:`SVG Source` or :guilabel:`Both`. The Rich Text editor will lose some information, so if you go all out, use :guilabel:`SVG Source`.

Word-spacing, Letter-spacing and Kerning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These three are written and read from the rich text tab, but have no sliders associated with them, because there was no time.

Kerning
    `Kerning, in SVG 1.1 <https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/text.html#KerningProperty Kerning>`_ behaves slightly differently than font-kerning in css. Krita by default uses the auto property for this, which means it is on. To turn it off use kerning:0 in the style section of the text.

    .. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_text_kerning.png
       :align: center

    ::

        <text style="kerning:0; font-family:Dancing Script; font-size:18pt; font-size-adjust:0.265625">
            <tspan>No Kerning on Valhalla Tower.</tspan>
        </text>

Letter-spacing
    This is the distance between letters in pts, usually. Just write ``letter-spacing`` in the style and add a distance in pts behind it. A negative value will decrease the value between words.
Word-spacing
    This is the extra distance between words, defaulting to pts. By default, ``word-spacing: 0;`` will have it use only the width of the space character for that font. A negative value will decrease the amount of space between words:

    .. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_letter_and_word_spacing.png
       :align: center

    ::

        <text style="font-family:Noto Serif; font-size:12pt; font-size-adjust:0.389915; text-anchor:middle">
            <tspan>No Adjustment.</tspan>
            <tspan style="letter-spacing:2" x="0" dy="22pt">Letter spacing: 2</tspan>
            <tspan style="letter-spacing:-2" x="0" dy="22pt">Letter spacing: -2</tspan>
            <tspan style="word-spacing:5" x="0" dy="22pt">Word spacing: 5</tspan>
            <tspan style="word-spacing:-5" x="0" dy="22pt">Word spacing: -5</tspan>
        </text>


x, y, dx, dy
~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are even finer-grained controls that can be used to position text. However, they CANNOT be reliably converted to the format of the rich text editor, because the rich text editor uses these to figure out if a line is a new-line and thus writes to these.

X and Y
    X and Y are absolute coordinates. But because you cannot change the absolute coordinates of the text from the editor, these get added to the position when they show up in a tspan.
dx and dy
    These are relative coordinates to the position of the previous letter.

Font-stretch and Small-caps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These can also be stored and written to the rich text tab's internal format, but they don't get used in the on screen text object.

Dominant Baseline, Alignment baseline, Font-size-adjust, Writing mode, Glyph-orientation, rotate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are not stored in the rich text right now, and while they can be written into the SVG text, the SVG text-shape doesn't do anything with them. 

Krita generates font-size-adjust for the font when coming from rich text, as this can help designers when they want to use the SVG source as a basis for later adjustments.
