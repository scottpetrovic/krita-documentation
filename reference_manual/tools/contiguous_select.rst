Contiguous Selection Tool
=========================

|toolselectcontiguous|

This tool, represented by a magic wand, allows you to make :ref:`selections_basics` by selecting a point of color. It will select any contiguous areas of a similar color to the one you selected. You can adjust the "fuzziness" of the tool in the tool options dock. A lower number will select colors closer to the color that you chose in the first place.

Hotkeys and Sticky keys
-----------------------

* :kbd:`R` sets the selection to 'replace' in the tool options, this is the default mode.
* :kbd:`A` sets the selection to 'add' in the tool options.
* :kbd:`S` sets the selection to 'subtract' in the tool options.
* :kbd:`Shift` + |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to 'add'. You can release the :kbd:`Shift` key while dragging, but it will still be set to 'add'. Same for the others.
* :kbd:`Alt` + |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to  'subtract'.
* :kbd:`Ctrl` + |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to  'replace'.
* :kbd:`Shift + Alt +` |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to  'intersect'.

.. note::

    You can switch the behaviour of the Alt key to use Ctrl instead by toggling the switch in the :ref:`general_settings`

Tool Options
------------

Anti-aliasing
    This toggles whether or not to give selections feathered edges. Some people preffer hard-jagged adges for their selections.
Fuzziness
    This controls whether or not the contiguous selection sees another color as a border.
Grow/Shrink selection.
    This value extends/contracts the shape beyond it's initial size.
Feathering
    This value will add a soft border to the selection-shape.
Limit to Current Layer
    Activating this will prevent the fill tool from taking other layers into account.
