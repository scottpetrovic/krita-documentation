Assistant Tool
==============

|toolassistant|

Create, edit, and remove drawing assistants on the canvas. There are a number of different assistants that can be used from this tool. The tool options allow you to add new assistants, and to save/load assistants. To add a new assistant, select a type from the tool options and begin clicking on the canvas. Each assistant is created a bit differently. There are also additional controls on existing assistants that allow you to move and delete them.

The set of assistants on the current canvas can be saved to a ".paintingassistant" file using the Save button in the tool options. These assistants can then be loaded onto a different canvas using the Open button. This functionality is also useful for creating copies of the same drawing assistant(s) on the current canvas.

Check :ref:`painting_with_assistants` for more information.
