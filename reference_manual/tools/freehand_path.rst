==================
Freehand Path Tool
==================

|toolfreehandpath|

With the Freehand Path Tool you can draw a path (much like the :ref:`shape_brush_engine`) the shape will then be filled with the selected color or pattern and outlined with a brush if so chosen. While drawing a preview line is shown that can be modified in pattern, width and color.

This tool can be particularly good for laying in large swaths of color quickly.
