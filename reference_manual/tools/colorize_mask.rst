Colorize Mask

|toolcolorizemask|

A tool for quickly coloring lineart, the Colorize Mask Editing tool can be found next to the gradient tool on your toolbox.

This feature is technically already in 3.1, but disabled by default because we had not optimised the filling algorithm for production use yet. To enable it, find your krita configuration file, open it in notepad, and add "disableColorizeMaskFeature=false" to the top. Then restart Krita. Its official incarnation is in 4.0.


Usage
-----

This tool works in conjunction with the colorize mask, and the usage is as follows:

For this example, we'll be using the ghost lady also used to explain masks on the basic concepts page.

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_usage_01.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center 

This image has the line art for the lady seperated from the background, and what's more, the background is made up of two layers: one main and one for the details. 

First, select the colorize mask editing tool while having the lineart layer selected. |mouseleft| the canvas will add a colorize mask to the layer.
You can also |mouseright| the line art layer, and then :guilabel:`Add --> Colorize Mask`. The line art will suddenly become really weird, this is the prefiltering which are filters through which we put the lineart to make the algorithm easier to use. The tool options overview below shows which options control that.

   :width: 800
   :align: center

Now, You make strokes with brush colors, press :guilabel:`Update` in the tool options, or tick the last icon of the colorize mask properties. In the layer docker, you will be able to see a little progress bar appear on the colorize mask indicating how long it takes. The bigger your file, the longer it will take.

   :width: 800
   :align: center

We want to have the blue transparent. In the tool options of the colorize editing tool you will see a small palette. These are the colors already used. You can remove colors here, or mark a single color as standing for transparent, by selecting it and pressing "transparent". Updating the mask will still show the blue stroke, but the result will be transparent:

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_usage_04.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center

Because the colorize mask algorithm is slow, and we only need a part of our layer to be filled to fill the whole ghost lady figure, we can make use of :guilabel:`Limit to layer bounds`. This will limit Colorize Mask to use the combined size of the line art and the coloring key strokes. Therefore, make sure that the colorizing keystrokes only take up as much as they really need.

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_usage_05.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center

Now the algorithm will be possibly a lot faster, allowing us to add strokes and press update in rapid succesion:

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_usage_06.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center

To see the final result, disable :guilabel:`Edit Key Strokes` or toggle the second to last icon on the colorize mask.

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_usage_07.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center

If you want to edit the strokes again, re-enable :guilabel:`Edit Key Strokes`.

Now, the colorize mask, being a mask, can also be added to a group of line art layers. It will then use the composition of the whole group as the line art. This is perfect for our background which has two seperate line art layers. It also means that the colorize mask will be disabled when added to a group with pass-through enabled, because those have no final composition. You can recognise a disabled colorize mask because it's name is striked through.

To add a colorize mask to a group, select the group and {{MouseButton|left` the canvas with the Colorize Mask editing tool, or |mouseright| the layer to :menuselection:`Add --> Colorize Mask`.

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_usage_08.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center

Now, we add strokes to the background quickly. We do not need to use the :menuselection:`Limit to Layer Bounds` because the background covers the whole image.

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_usage_09.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center

For the record, you can use other brushes and tools also work on the colorize mask as long as they can draw. The Colorize Mask Editing tool is just the most convenient because you can get to the algorithm options.

Out final result looks like this:

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_usage_10.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center

Now we are done, |mouseright| the colorize mask and :menuselection:`Convert --> to Paint Layer`. Then, :menuselection:`Layer --> Split --> Split Layer`. This will give seperate color islands that you can easily edit:

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_usage_11.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center

This way we can very quickly paint the image. Due to the colorize mask going from the first image to the following took only 30 minutes, and would've taken quite a bit longer.

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_usage_12.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center

The colorize masks are saved to the .kra file, so as long as you don't save and open to a different file format, nor convert the colorize mask to a paintlayer, you can keep working adjust the results.

Tool Options
------------

Update
    Run the colorize mask algorithm. The progress bar for updates on a colorize mask shows only in the layer docker.
Edit key strokes
    Put the mask into edit mode. In edit mode, it will also show the 'pre-filtering' on the line-art, which is for example a blur filter for gap closing.
Show output
    Show the output of the colorize mask. If :guilabel:`Edit key strokes` is active, this will be shown semi-transparently, so it will be easy to recognise the difference between the strokes and the output.
    
    .. figure:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_show_output_edit_strokes.png
       :width: 800
       :align: center
       
       On the **Left**: :guilabel:`Show Output` is on, :guilabel:`Edit Strokes` is off. In the **Middle**: :guilabel:`Show Output` and :guilabel:`Edit Strokes` are on. On the **Right**: :guilabel:`Show Output` is off and :guilabel:`Edit Strokes` is on.]]

Limit to layer bounds
    Limit the colorize mask to the combined layer bounds of the strokes and the line art it is filling. This can speed up the use of the mask on complicated compositions, such as comic pages.
Edge detection
    Activate this for line art with large solid areas, for example shadows on an object. For the best use, set the value to the thinnest lines on the image. In the imag ebelow, note how edge detection affects the big black areas:

    .. figure:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_edge_detection.png
       :width: 800
       :align: center
   
       From left to right: an example with big black shadows on an object but no edge detection, the same example without the edit strokes enabled. Then the same example with edge detection enabled and set to 2px, and that same example with out edit strokes enabled.

Gap close hint
    While the algorithm is pretty good against gaps in contours, this will improve the gap recognition. The higher this value is, the bigger the gaps it will try to close, but a too high value can lead to other errors. Note how the pre-filtered line art(that's the blurry haze) affects the color patches.
    
    .. figure:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_colorize_mask_gap_close_hint.png
       :width: 800
       :align: center
       
       On the **Left**: :guilabel:`Gap close hint` is 0px. In the **Middle**: :guilabel:`Gap close hint` is 15px(the lines are 10px). On the **Right**: :guilabel:`Gap close hint` is 275px.
Clean-up strokes
    This will attempt to handle messy strokes that overlap the line art where they shouldn't. At 0 no clean up is done, at 100% the clean-up is most aggressive.

       :align: center

Keystrokes
    This palette keeps track of the colors used by the strokes. This is useful so you can switch back to colors easily. You can increase the swatch size by hovering over it with the mouse, and doing :kbd:`ctrl +` |mousescroll|.
Transparent
    This button is under the keystrokes palette, you can mark the selected color to be interpreted a 'transparent' with this. In the clean-up screenshot above, cyan had been marked as transparent.

Layer properties
----------------

The colorize mask layer has four properties. They are all the buttons on the right side of the layer:

Show output
 The first button, it allows you to toggle whether you'll see the output from the colorize algorithm.
Lock
 Stops the mask from being edited.
Edit key strokes
 Whether the colorize mask is in edit mode. In edit mode it'll show the strokes, and the output will be semi-transparent.
Update
 The last button will force the colorize mask to update, even when you're in a different tool.

Colorize masks cannot be animated.
