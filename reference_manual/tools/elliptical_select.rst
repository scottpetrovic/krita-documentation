Elliptical Selection Tool
=========================

|toolselectellipse|

This tool, represented by a ellipse with a dashed border, allows you to make :ref:`selections_basics` of a elliptical area. Simply click and drag around the section you wish to select.

Hotkeys and Stickykeys
----------------------

* :kbd:`J` selects this tool.
* :kbd:`R` sets the selection to 'replace' in the tool options, this is the default mode.
* :kbd:`A` sets the selection to 'add' in the tool options.
* :kbd:`S` sets the selection to 'subtract' in the tool options.
* :kbd:`Shift` after starting the selection, constraints it to a perfect circle.
* :kbd:`Ctrl` after starting the selection, makes the selection resize from center.
* :kbd:`Alt` after starting the selection, allows you to move it.
* :kbd:`Shift` + |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to 'add'. You can release the :kbd:`Shift` key while dragging, but it will still be set to 'add'. Same for the others.
* :kbd:`Alt` + |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to  'subtract'.
* :kbd:`Ctrl` + |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to  'replace'.
* :kbd:`Shift + Alt +` |mouseleft| sets the subsequent selection to  'intersect'.

.. note::

    So to subtract a perfect circle, you do :kbd:`Alt +` |mouseleft|, then release the :kbd:`Alt` key while dragging and press :kbd:`Shift` to constrain.


.. note::

    You can switch the behaviour of the Alt key to use Ctrl instead by toggling the switch in the :ref:`general_settings`
