Rectangle Tool
==============

|toolrectangle|

This tool can be used to paint rectangles, or create rectangle shapes on a vector layer. Click and hold the left mouse button to indicate one corner of the rectangle, drag to the opposite corner, and release the button.

Hotkeys and Sticky-keys
-----------------------

There's no default hotkey for switching to rectangle.

If you hold :kbd:`Shift` while drawing, a square will be drawn instead of a rectangle. Holding :kbd:`Ctrl` will change the way the rectangle is constructed. Normally, the first mouse click indicates one corner and the second click the opposite. With :kbd:`Ctrl`, the initial mouse position indicates the center of the rectangle, and the final mouse position indicates a corner. You can press :kbd:`Alt` while still keeping the left mouse button down to move the rectangle to a different location.

You can change between the corner/corner and center/corner drawing methods as often
as you want by pressing or releasing :kbd:`Ctrl`, provided that you keep the left mouse button pressed. With :kbd:`Ctrl` pressed, mouse movements will affect all four corners of the rectangle (relative to the center), without :kbd:`Ctrl`, one of the corners is unaffected.
