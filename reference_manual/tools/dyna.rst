==================
Dynamic Brush Tool
==================

|tooldyna|

Add custom smoothing dynamics to your brush. This will give you similar smoothing results as the normal freehand brush. There are a couple options that you can change.

Mass
 Average your movement to make it appear smoother. Higher values will make your brush move slower.
Drag
 A rubberband effect that will help your lines come back to your cursor. lower values will make the effect more extreme.

Recommended values are around 0.02 Mass and 0.92 Drag.
