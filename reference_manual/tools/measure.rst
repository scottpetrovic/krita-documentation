This tool is used to measure distances and angles. Click the Left Mouse button to indicate the first endpoint or vertex of the angle, keep the button pressed, drag to the second endpoint and release the button. The results will be shown on the Tool Options docker. You can choose the length units from the drop-down list.

The measure tool-options allow you to change between the units used. Unit conversion varies depending on the DPI setting of a document.
