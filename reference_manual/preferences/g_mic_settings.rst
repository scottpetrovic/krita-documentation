G'Mic or GREYC's Magic for Image Computing is an opensource filter framework, or, it is an extra program you can download to have access to a whole lot of image filters.

Krita has had G'Mic integration for a long time, but this is its most stable incarnation.

You set it up as following:

#. First download the proper krita plugin from `the G'Mic website. <http://gmic.eu/download.shtml>`_
#. Then, unzip and place it somewhere you can find it.
#. Go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure Krita --> G'Mic plugin` and set G'MIC to the filepath there.
#. Then restart Krita.
