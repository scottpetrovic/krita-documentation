Tablet 
    Input Pressure Global Curve : This is the global curve setting that your tablet will use in Krita. The settings here will make your tablet feel soft or hard globally.
For Krita 3.3 or later:Tablet Input API
    on Windows 8 or above only

    WinTab
        Use the WinTab API to receive tablet pen input. This is the API being used before Krita 3.3. This option is recommended for most Wacom tablets.
    Windows 8+ Pointer Input
        Use the Pointer Input messages to receive tablet pen input. This option depends on Windows Ink support from the tablet driver. This is a relatively new addition so it's still considered to be experimental, but it should work well enough for painting. You should try this if you are using an N-Trig device (e.g. recent Microsoft Surface devices) or if your tablet does not work well with WinTab.


If your tablet doesn't work with Krita, check out the :ref:`page on drawing tablets <drawing_tablets>`.
