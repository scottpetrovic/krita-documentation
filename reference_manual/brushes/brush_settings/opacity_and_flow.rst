Opacity and Flow
================

Opacity and flow are parameters for the transparency of a brush.

They are interlinked with the painting mode setting.

Opacity
    The transparency of a stroke.
Flow
    The transparency of separate dabs. Finally separated from Opacity in 2.9

Painting mode
-------------

Build-up
    Will treat opacity as if it were the same as flow.
Wash
    Will treat opacity as stroke transparency instead of dab-transparency.

where the other images of this page had all three strokes set to painting mode: wash, this one is set to build-up.
