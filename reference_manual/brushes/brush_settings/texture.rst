Texture
=======

This allows you to have textured strokes. This parameter always shows up as two parameters:

Texture
-------

Pattern
    Which pattern you'll be using. 
Scale
    The size of the pattern. 1.0 is 100%.

Horizontal Offset & Vertical Offset
    How much a brush is offset, random offset sets a new per stroke.

Texturing mode
    Multiply
        Uses alpha multiplication to determine the effect of the texture. Has a soft feel.
    Subtract
        Uses substraction to determine the effect of the texture. Has a harsher, more texture feel.

Cutoff policy
    Cutoff policy will determine what range and where the strength will affect the textured outcome.

    Disabled
        doesn't cut off. Full range will be used.
    Pattern
        cuts the pattern off.
    Brush
        Cuts the brush-tip off.

Cutoff
    Cutoff is... the grayscale range that you can limit the texture to. This also affects the limit takes by the strength. In the below example, we move from the right arrow moved close to the left one, resulting in only the darkest values being drawn. After that, three images with larger range, and underneath that, three ranges with the left arrow moved, result in the darkest values being cut away, leaving only the lightest. The last example is the pattern without cutoff.

Invert Pattern
    Invert the pattern.

Brightness and Contrast .. versionadded:: 3.3.1
    Adjust the pattern with a simple brightness/contrast filter to make it easier to use. Because Subtract and Multiply work differently, it's recommended to use different values with each:

Strength
--------

This allows you to set the texture to Sensors. It will use the cutoff to continuously draw lighter values of the texture(making the result darker)
