Filter Brush Engine
===================

.. image:: /images/icons/filterbrush.svg

Where in other programs you have a 'dodge tool', 'blur tool' and 'sharpen tool', Krita has a special brush engine for this: The Filter Brush engine. On top of that, due to Krita's great integration of the filters, a huge amount of filters you'd never thought you wanted to use for a drawing are possible in brush form too!

Options
-------

The filter brush has of course some basic brush-system parameters:

* :ref:`option_brush_tip`
* :ref:`blending_modes`
* :ref:`option_opacity_n_flow`
* :ref:`option_size`
* :ref:`option_mirror`
* :ref:`option_rotation`
