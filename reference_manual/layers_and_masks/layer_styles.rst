============
Layer Styles
============

Layer styles are effects that are added on top of your layer. They are editable and can easily be toggled on and off. To add a layer style to a layer go to :menuselection:`Layer --> Layer Style`. You can also right-click a layer to access the layer styles.


When you have the layer styles window up, make sure that the "Enable Effects" is checked.

There are a variety of effects and styles you can apply to a layer. When you add a style, your layer docker will show an extra "Fx" icon. This allows you to toggle the layer style effects on and off.  



.. note::

    This feature was added to increase support for :program:`Adobe Photoshop`. The features that are included mirror what that application supports.
