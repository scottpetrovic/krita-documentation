============
Brush Preset
============

Paint Op presets store the preview thumbnail, brush-engine, the parameters, the brush tip, and, if possible, the texture. They are saved as .kpp files

For information regarding the brush system, see :ref:`Brushes <loading_saving_brushes>`.

The Docker
----------

The docker for Paint-op presets is the :ref:`brush_preset_docker`. Here you can tag, add, remove and search paint op presets.

Editing the preview thumbnail
-----------------------------

You can edit the preview thumbnail in the brush-scratchpad, but you can also open the *.kpp file in Krita to get a 200x200 file to edit to your wishes.
