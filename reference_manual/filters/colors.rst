Similar to the Adjust filters, the color filter are image wide color operations.

.. index:: ! Color to Alpha
.. _filter_color_to_alpha:

Color to Alpha
--------------

This filter allows you to make one single color transparent(alpha). By default when you run this filter white is selected, you can choose a color that you want to make transparent from the color selector

The Threshold indicates how much other colors will be considered mixture of the removed color and non-removed colors.
For example, with threshold set to 255, and the removed color set to white, a 50% grey will be considered a mixture of black+white, and thus transformed in a 50% transparent black.

This filter is really useful in separating line-art from the white background.

.. _filter_color_transfer:

Color Transfer
--------------

This filter converts the colors of the image to colors from the reference image.
This is a quick way to change a color combination of an artwork to an already saved image or a reference image.

.. _filter_maximize_channel:

Maximize Channel
----------------

This filter checks for all the channels of a each single color and set all but the highest value to 0.

.. _filter_minimize_channel:

Minimize Channel
----------------

This is reverse to Maximise channel, it checks all the channels of a each single color and sets all but the lowest to 0.
