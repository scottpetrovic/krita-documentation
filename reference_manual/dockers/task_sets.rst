Task sets can record any kind of command also available via the shortcut manager. It can not record strokes, like the macro recorder can. However, you can play macros with the tasksets!

The tasksets docker has a record button, and you can use this to record a certain workflow. Then use this to let items appear in the taskset list. After wards, turn off record. You can then click any action in the list to make them happen. Press the 'Save' icon to name and save the taskset.
