This docker allows you to quickly shift between undo states, and even go back in time far more quickly that rapidly reusing :kbd:`Ctrl + Z`

..index:: Cumulate Undo

Cumulative Undo
---------------

|mouseright| an item in the undo-history docker to enable cumulative undo. |mouseright| again to change the parameters:

Start merging time
    The amount of seconds required to consider a group of strokes to be worth one undo step.
Group time
    According to this parameter -- groups are made. Every stroke is put into the same group till two consecutive strokes have a time gap of more than T seconds. Then a new group is started. 
Split strokes.
    A user may want to keep the ability of Undoing/Redoing his last N strokes. Once N is crossed -- the earlier strokes are merged into the group's first stroke.
