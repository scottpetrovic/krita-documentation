This is docker only applies for Vector Layers. Snapping determines where a vector shape will snap. The little number box is for snapping to a grid.

Node
    For snapping to other vector nodes.
Extensions of Line
    For snapping to a point that could have been part of a line, had it been extended.
Bounding Box
    For snapping to the bounding box of a vector shape.
Orthogonal
    For snapping to only horizontal or vertical lines.
Intersection
    for snapping to other vector lines.
Guides
    Guides don't exist in Krita, therefore this one is useless.
