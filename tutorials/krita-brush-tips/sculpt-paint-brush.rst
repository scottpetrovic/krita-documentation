Question
--------

**How do I make a brush like the one in Sinix's paint-like-a-sculptor video?**

It's actually quite easy, but most easy to do since Krita 3.0 due a few bugfixes.

First, select *Basic_Wet* from the default presets, and go into the brush editor with :kbd:`f5`.

Then, the trick is to go into **Opacity**, untoggle **Pressure** from the sensors, toggle **Fade** and then reverse the curve as shown above. Make sure that the curve ends a little above the bottom-right, so that you are aways painting something. Otherwise, the smudge won't work.

This'll make the color rate decrease and turn it into a smudge brush as the stroke continues:

The **Fade** sensor will base the stroke length on brush size. The **Distance** sensor will base it on actual pixels, and the **Time** on actual seconds.

Then, select :menuselection:`Brushtip --> Predfined` and select the default *A_Angular_Church_HR* brushtip.

This makes for a nice textured square brush.

Of course, this'll make the stroke distance longer to get to smudging, so we go back to the *Opacity*.

Just adjust the fade-length by |mouseright| on the slider bar. You can then input a number. In the screenshot, I have 500, but the sweet spot seems to be somewhere betwen 150 and 200.

Now, you'll notice that on the start of a stroke, it might be a little faded, so go into **Color Rate** and turn off the **Enable Pen Settings** there.

Then, finally, we'll make the brush rotate.

Tick the **Rotation** parameter, and select it. There, untick **Pressure** and tick **Drawing Angle**.

Then, for better angling, tick **Lock** and set the **Angle Offset** to 90 degrees by |mouseright| the slider bar and typing in 90.

Now, give your brush a new name, doodle on the brush-square, **Save to presets** and paint!
