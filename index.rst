  Welcome to the Krita |version| Manual!
=========================================

Welcome to Krita's documentation page. Krita is a sketching and painting program designed for digital artists.

As you learn about Krita, keep in mind that it is not intended as a replacement for Photoshop. This means that the other programs may have more features than Krita for image manipulation tasks, such as stitching together photos, while Krita's tools are most relevant to digital painting, concept art, illustration, and texturing. This fact accounts for a great deal of Krita's design.
