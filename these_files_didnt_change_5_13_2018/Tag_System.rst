Tag System
==========

Tags are how you organize common types of resources. Tags can be used
with brushes, gradients, patterns, and even brush tips. Tags are usually
selected from a drop-down menu above the resources. Selecting a tag will
filter all of the resources by that tag. Selecting the tag of “All” will
show all resources. Krita comes installed with a few default tags. You
can create and edit your own as well. The tags are managed in a similar
way across the different types of resources.

You can use tags together with the `Pop-up
Palette <Special:MyLanguage/Navigation#Pop-up_Palette>`__ for increased
productivity.
