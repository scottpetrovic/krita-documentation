.bmp
====

.bmp, or Bitmap, is the simplest raster file format out there, and,
being patent-free, most programs can open and save bitmap files.

However, most programs don't compress bitmap files, leading to BMP
having a reputation for being very heavy. If you need a lossless file
format, we actually recommend :doc:`.png`.
