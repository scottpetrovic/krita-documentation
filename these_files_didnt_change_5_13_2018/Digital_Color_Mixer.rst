This docker allows you to do simple mathematical color mixing.

It works as follows:

You have on the left side the current color.

Next to that there's six columns. Each of these column consists of three
rows: The lowest row is the color that you are mixing the current color
with. Ticking this button allows you to set a different colour using a
palette and the mini-color wheel. The slider above this mixing color
represent the proportions of the mixing color and the current color. The
higher the slider, the less of the mixing color will be used in mixing.
Finally, the result color. Clicking this will change your current color
to the result color.
