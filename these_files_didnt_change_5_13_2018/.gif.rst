.gif
====

.gif is a fileformat mostly known for the fact that it can save
animations. It's a fairly old format, and it does it's compression by
`indexing <Special:MyLanguage/Bit_Depth>`__ the colors to a maximum of
256 colors per frame.

This means that it can handle most grayscale images just fine and
without losing any visible quality. But for color images that don't
animate it might be better to use :doc:`.jpg` or :doc:`.png`.
