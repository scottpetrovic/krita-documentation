Brush-tips:Bokeh

Question
    How do you do bokeh effects?

First, blur your image with the Lens Blur to roughly 50 pixels.

Take smudge\_textured, add scattering, turn off tablet input.

Change the brush-tip to ‘Bokey’ and
check ‘overlay’ (you will want to play with the spacing as well)

Then make a new layer over your drawing,
set that to ‘lighter color’(it’s under lighter catagory) and painter
over it with you brush.

Overlay mode on the smudge brush allows
you to sample all the layers, and the ‘lighter color’ blending mode
makes sure that the Bokeh circles only show up when they are a lighter
color than the original pixels underneath. You can further modify this
brush by adding a ‘fuzzy’ sensor to the spacing and size options,
changing the brush blending mode to ‘addition’, or by choosing a
different brush-tip.
