Krita has one of the most powerful and capable Fill functions available.
The options found in the Tool Options docker and outlined below will
give you a great deal of flexibility working with layers and selections.

To get started, clicking anywhere on screen with the fill-tool will
allow that area to be filed with the foreground color.

Fast Mode
    This is a special mode for really fast filling. However, many
    functions don't work with this mode.
Threshold
    Determines when the fill-tool sees another color as a border.
Grow Selection
    This value extends the shape beyond it's initial size.
Feathering Radius
    This value will add a soft border to the filled-shape.
Fill Entire Selection
    Activating this will result in the shape filling the whole of the
    active selection, regardless of threshold.
Limit to current layer
    Activating this will prevent the fill tool from taking other layers
    into account.
Use Pattern
    Ticking this will result in the active pattern being used.
