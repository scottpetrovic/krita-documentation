Brush-tips:Outline
==================

Question
    How to make an outline for a single brush stroke using Krita?

Not really a brush, but what you can do is add a layer style to a layer,
by a layer and selecting *layer style*. Then input the following
settings: 

.. figure:: images/brush-tips_outline/Krita-layerstyle_hack.png
   :alt: images/brush-tips_outline/Krita-layerstyle_hack.png
   :align: center

Then, set the main layer to *multiply*\ (or add a `color to
alpha <Special:MyLanguage/colors>`__ filter mask), and paint with white:

.. figure:: images/brush-tips_outline/Krita-layerstyle_hack2.png
   :alt: images/brush-tips_outline/Krita-layerstyle_hack2.png
   :align: center

(The white thing is the pop-up that you see as you hover over the layer)

Merge into a empty clear layer after ward to fix all the effects.
