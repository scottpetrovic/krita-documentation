.pbm
====

.pbm, :doc:`.pgm`, :doc:`.ppm` are a series of
file-formats with a similar logic to them. They are designed to save
images in a way that the result can be read as an ascii file, from back
when email clients couldn't read images reliably.

It's a very old file format, and not used outside of very experimental
usecases.

.pbm is one-bit and can only show strict black and white.
