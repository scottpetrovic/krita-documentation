Resource Management
===================

Resources are pluggable bits of data, like brush presets or patterns.
Krita has variety of resources and also has a good resource management
starting from 2.9, making it really easy for artists to share and
collate all the resources together

Bundles
    Starting from 2.9 Krita has a new format to manage resources it is
    called *Bundles*, a bundle is just a compressed file containing all
    the resources together.

Tags
    Krita also has a robust tagging system for you to manage the
    resources on the fly while painting.All Krita resources can be
    tagged. These tags can be added via the resource manager, but also
    via the respective dockers such as brush preset docker, pattern
    docker etc. you can the plus icon in the docker and add a tag name.
    in addition to adding you can rename and delete a tag as well.

-  Resources can belong to one or more tags. For example, you may have a
   Brush Preset of a favorite **Ink Pen** variant and have it tagged so
   it shows in up in your Inking, Painting, Comics and Favorites groups
   of brushes.

-  Brushes in the “Predefined” tab of the Brush Settings Editor can be
   also tagged and grouped for convenience.

Tags are saved in an xml file in the resource folder:

Filtering
    Some dockers, for example the brush preset docker as shown below,
    have a resource filter, which functions like a powerful search bar
    for the resource in question.

.. figure:: images/resource_management/Brushpreset-filters.png
   :alt: images/resource_management/Brushpreset-filters.png
   :align: center

You can enter brush name, tag name to quickly pull up a list of brush
preset you want. When you select any tag from the tag dropdown and want
to include brush presets from other tags as well then you can add
filters the following way:

-  To filter based on the partial, case insensitive name of the
   resources you can add

   .. code-block:: text

      partialname

   or

   .. code-block:: text

      !partialname

-  To include other Tags type the respective name of the tag in square
   brackets like this

   .. code-block:: text

      [Tagname]

   or to exclude a tag type

   .. code-block:: text

      ![Tagname]

-  For case sensitive matching of preset name type

   .. code-block:: text

      “Preset name”

   or

   .. code-block:: text

      ! “Preset name”

   to exclude.

An incredibly quick way to save a group or brushes into a tag is to:

#. Create a new tag by on the green plus sign. This will empty out the
   contents of the Brush Preset docker.
#. Use the Resource Filter at the bottom of the Brush Presets dock or
   Brush Settings Editor to type in what you want to group. For
   instance: if you type **Pencil** in the filter box you will get all
   Brush Presets with **Pencil** somewhere in their name. Now you have
   all the Pencil-related Brush Presets together in one place.
#. To finish, click the Save button (small disk icon to the right of the
   Resource Filter box) or press :kbd:`Enter` and all the items will
   be saved with the new tag you created.

Now, anytime you want to open up your “digital pencil box” and see what
you have to work with all you have to do is use the pull-down and select
**Pencils**. The Resource Filter works the same way in other parts of
Krita so be on the lookout for it!

Resource Zooming
    If you find the thumbnails of the resources such as color swatches
    brushes and pattern to be small you can make them bigger or **zoom
    in**. All resource selectors can be zoomed in and out of, by
    hovering over the selector and using :kbd:`Ctrl` + mouse wheel
    to zoom in or out.

Krita offers following types of resources :

-  `Brush tips <Special:MyLanguage/Krita/Manual/Resources/BrushTips>`__
-  `Paintop presets <Special:MyLanguage/Krita/Manual/Resources/PaintOps>`__
-  `Gradients <Special:MyLanguage/Krita/Manual/Resources/Gradients>`__
-  `Patterns <Special:MyLanguage/Krita/Manual/Resources/Patterns>`__
-  `Palettes <Special:MyLanguage/Krita/Manual/Resources/Palettes>`__
-  `Workspaces <Special:MyLanguage/Krita/Manual/Resources/Workspaces>`__

Managing Resources
------------------

As mentioned earlier Krita has a flexible resource management system.
Starting from version 2.9 you can share various resources mentioned
above by sharing a single compressed zip file created within Krita.

The manage resources section in the settings was also revamped for
making it easy for the artists to prepare these bundle files. You can
open manage resource section by going to
:menuselection:`Settings` then :menuselection:`Manage Resources`
