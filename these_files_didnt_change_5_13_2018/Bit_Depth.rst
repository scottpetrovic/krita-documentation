Bit Depth
=========

Bit depth basically refers to the amount of working memory per pixel you
reserve for an image.

Like how having a A2 paper in real life can allow for much more detail
in the end drawing, it does take up more of your desk than a simple A4
paper.

However, this does not just refer to the size of the image, but also how
much precision you need per colour.

To illustrate this, I'll briefly talk about something that is not even
available in Krita:

Indexed Colour.
---------------

In older programs, the computer would have per image, a palette that
contains a number for each color. The palette size is defined in bits,
because the computer can only store data in bit-sizes.

1bit
    Only two colours in total, usually black and white.
4bit(16 colors)
    16 colors in total, these are famous as many early games were
    presented in this color palette.
8bit
    256 colors in total. 8bit images are commonly used in games to save
    on memory for textures and sprites.

However, this is not available in Krita. Krita instead works with
channels, and counts how many colors per channel you need(described in
terms of *bits per channel*). This is called 'real colour'.

   1, 2, and 3bit per channel don't actually exist in any graphics
   application out there, however, by imagining them, we can imagine how
   each bit affects the precision: Usually, each bit subdivides each
   section in the color cube meaning precision becomes a power of 2
   bigger than the previous cube.

4bit per channel(not supported by Krita)
    Also known as Hi-color, or 16bit color total. A bit of an old
    system, and not used outside of specific displays.
8bit per channel
    Also known as “True Color”, “Millions of colors” or “24bit/32bit”.
    The standard for many screens, and the lowest bit-depth Krita can
    handle.
16bit per channel.
    One step up from 8bit, 16bit per channel allows for colors that
    can't be displayed by the screen. However, due to this, you are more
    likely to have smoother gradients. Sometimes known as “Deep Color”.
    This color depth type doesn't have negative values possible, so it
    is 16bit precision, meaning that you have have 65536 values per
    channel.
16bit float
    Similar to 16bit, but with more range and less precision. Where
    16bit only allows coordinates like [1, 4, 3], 16bit float has
    coordinates like [0.15, 0.70, 0.3759], with [1.0,1.0,1.0]
    representing white. Because of the differences between floating
    point and integer type variables, and because Scene-referred imaging
    allows for negative values, you have about 10-11bits of precision
    per channel in 16 bit floating point compared to 16 bit in 16 bit
    int(This is 2048 values per channel in the 0-1 range) Required for
    HDR/Scene referred images, and often known as 'half floating point'.
32bit float
    similar to 16bit float but with even higher precision. The native
    color depth of OpenColor IO, and thus faster than 16bit float in HDR
    images, if not heavier. Because of the nature of floating point type
    variables, 32bit float is roughly equal to 23-24 bits of precision
    per channel(16777216 values per channel in the 0-1 range), but with
    a much wider range(it can go far above 1), necessary for
    HDR/Scene-referred values. It is also known as 'single floating
    point'.

This is important if you have a working colour space that is larger than
your device space: At the least, if you do not want colour banding.

And while you can attempt to create all your images a 32bit float, this
will quickly take up your ram. Therefore, it's important to consider
which bit depth you will use for what kind of image.
