File Formats
============

This category is for graphics file-formats. While most file-formats can
be looked up on wikipedia, this doesn't always explain what the format
can be used for and what it's strengths and weaknesses are.

In this category we try to describe these in a manner that can be read
by beginners.

Generally, there's the following features that people pay attention to
in regards to fileformats:

Compression
-----------

Compression is how the file-format tries to describe the image with as
little data as possible, so that the resulting file is as small as it
can get without losing quality.

What we generally see is that formats that are small on disk either lose
image quality, or require the computer to spent a lot of time thinking
about how the image should look.

Vector file-formats like ``svg`` are a typical example of the
latter. They are really small because the technology used to create them
is based on mathematics, so it only stores maths-variables and can
achieve a very high quality. The downside is that the computer needs to
spend a lot of time thinking on how it should look, and sometimes
different programs have different ways of interpreting the values.
Furthermore, vector file-formats imply vector graphics, which is a very
different way of working than Krita is specialised in.

Lossy file formats, like ``jpg`` or ``webp`` are an example of
small on disk, but lowering the quality, and are best used for very
particular types of images. Lossy thus means that the file format plays
fast and loose with describing your image to reduce filesize.

Non-lossy or lossless formats, like ``png``, ``gif`` or
``bmp`` are in contrast, much heavier on disk, but much more likely
to retain quality.

Then, there's proper working file formats like Krita's ``.kra``,
Gimp's ``xcf``, Photoshop's ``psd``, but also interchange
formats like ora and exr. These are the heaviest on the hard-drive and
often require special programs to open them up, but on the other hand
these are meant to keep your working enviroment in tact, and keep all
the layers and guides in them.

Metadata
--------

Metadata is the ability of a fileformat to contain information outside
of the actual image contents. This can be human readable data, like the
date of creation, the name of the author, a description of the image,
but also computer readable data, like an icc-profile which tells the
computer about the qualities of how the colors inside the file should be
read.

Openness
--------

This is a bit of an odd quality, but it's about how easy it to open or
recover the file, and how widely it's supported.

Most internal fileformats, like PSD are completely closed, and it's
really difficult for human outsiders to recover the data inside without
opening photoshop. Other examples are camera raw files which have
different properties per camera manufacturer.

SVG, as a vector fileformat, is on the other end of the spectrum, and
can be opened with any text-editor and edited.

Most formats are in-between, and thus there's also a matter of how
widely supported the format is. jpg and png cannot be read or edited by
human eyes, but the vast majority of programs can open them, meaning the
owner has easy access to them.
