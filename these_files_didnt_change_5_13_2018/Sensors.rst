Sensors
=======

Pressure
    Uses the pressure input of your tablet.
X-tilt
    How much the brush is affected by stylus angle, if supported.
Y-tilt
    How much the brush is affected by stylus angle, if supported.
Tilt-direction
    How much the brush is affected by stylus direction. The pen point
    pointing towards the user is 0°, and can vary from -180° to +180°.
Tilt-elevation
    How much the brush is affected by stylus perpendicularity. 0° is the
    stylus horizontal, 90° is the stylus vertical.
Speed
    How much the brush is affected by the speed at which you draw.
Drawing Angle
    How much the brush is affected by which direction you are drawing
    in. will lock the angle to the one you started the stroke with. will
    try to smoothly round the corners, with the angle being the angles
    threshold it'll round. will add an extra offset to the current
    angle.
Rotation
    How much a brush is affected by how the stylus is rotated, if
    supported by the tablet.
Distance
    How much the brush is affected over length in pixels.
Time
    How much a brush is affected over drawing time in seconds..
Fuzzy (Dab)
    Basically the random option. allows for negative and positive
    numbers from the random.
Fuzzy Stroke
    A randomness value that is per stroke. Useful for getting color and
    size variation in on speed-paint brushes.
Fade
    How much the brush is affected over length, proportional to the
    brush tine.
Perspective
    How much the brush is affected by the perspective assistant.
Tangential Pressure
    How much the brush is affected by the wheel on airbrush-simulating
    stylii.
