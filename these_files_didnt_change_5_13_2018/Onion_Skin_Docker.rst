Onion Skin Docker
=================

To make animation easier, it helps to see both the next frame as well as
the previous frame sort of layered on top of the current. This is called
*onion-skinning*.

Basically, they are images that represent the
frames before and after the current frame, usually colored or tinted.

You can toggle them by clicking the lightbulb icon on a layer that is
animated(so, has frames), and isn’t fully opaque. (Krita will consider
white to be white, not transparent, so don’t animated on an opaque layer
if you want onion skins.)

The term onionskin comes from the fact that onions are semi-transparent.
In traditional animation animations would make their initial animations
on semitransparent paper on top of an light-table(of the special
animators variety), and they’d start with so called keyframes, and then
draw frames in between. For that, they would place said keyframes below
the frame they were working on, and the light table would make the lines
of the keyframes shine through, so they could reference them.

Onion-skinning is a digital implementation of such a workflow, and it’s
very useful when trying to animate.

The slider and the button with zero offset control the master opacity
and visibility of all the onion skins. The boxes at the top allow you to
toggle them on and off quickly, the main slider in the middle is a sort
of ‘master transparancy’ while the sliders to the side allow you to
control the transparency per keyframe offset.

Tint controls how strongly the frames are tinted, the first screen has
100%, which creates a silhouette, while below you can still see a bit of
the original colors at 50%.

Previous and next frame allows you set the colors.
