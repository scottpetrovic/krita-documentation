Managing Brush Presets
======================

Paint Op presets store the preview thumbnail, brush-engine, the
parameters, the brush tip, and, if possible, the texture. They are saved
as .kpp files

For information regarding the brush system, see
:doc:`Brushes <Loading_and_Saving_Brushes>`.

The Docker
----------

The docker for Paint-op presets is the Brush Preset docker. Here you can
tag, add, remove and search paint op presets.

Editing the preview thumbnail
-----------------------------

You can edit the preview thumbnail in the brush-scratchpad, but you can
also open the \*.kpp file in Krita to get a 200x200 file to edit to your
wishes.
