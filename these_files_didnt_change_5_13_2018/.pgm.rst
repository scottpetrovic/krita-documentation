.pgm
====

:doc:`.pbm`, .pgm, :doc:`.ppm` are a series
of file-formats with a similar logic to them. They are designed to save
images in a way that the result can be read as an ascii file, from back
when email clients couldn't read images reliably.

It's a very old file format, and not used outside of very experimental
usecases.

.pgm can show 255 values of gray(8bit).
