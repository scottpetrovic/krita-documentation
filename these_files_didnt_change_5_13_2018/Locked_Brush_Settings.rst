Locked Brush Settings
=====================

Normally, a changing to a different brush preset will change all brush
settings.Locked presets are a way for you to prevent Krita from changing
all settings.So, if you want to have the texture be that same over all
brushes, you lock the texture parameter. That way, all brush-preset you
select will now share the same texture!

Locking a brush parameter
-------------------------

To lock an option, the little chain icon next to the parameter name, and
set it to 'Lock'.It will now be highlighted to show it's locked:

And on the canvas, it will show that the texture-option is locked.

Unlocking a brush parameter
---------------------------

To *unlock*, the chain-icon again.

There will be two options:

Unlock (Drop Locked)
    This will get rid of the settings of the locked parameter and take
    that of the active brush preset. So if your brush had no texture on,
    using this option will revert it to having no texture.
Unlock (Keep Locked)
    This will keep the settings of the parameter even though it's
    unlocked.
