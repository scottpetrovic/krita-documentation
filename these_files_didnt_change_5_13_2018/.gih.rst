The GIMP image hose format. Krita can open and save these, as well as
import via the `predefined brush-tab <Special:MyLanguage/Brush_Tips>`__.

Image Hose means that this fileformat allows you to store multiple
images and then set some options to make it specify how to output the
multiple images.

   From top to bottom: Incremental, Pressure and Random

Gimp image hose format options:

Constant
    This'll use the first image, no matter what.
Incremental
    This'll paint the image layers in sequence. This is good for images
    that can be strung together to create a pattern.
Pressure
    This'll paint the images depending on pressure. This is good for
    brushes imitating the hairs of a natural brush.
Random
    This'll draw the images randomly. This is good for image-collections
    used in speedpainting as well as images that generate texture. Or
    perhaps more graphical symbols.
Angle
    This'll use the draging angle to determine with image to draw.

When exporting a krita file as a \*.gih, you will also get the option to
set the default spacing, the option to set the name(very important for
looking it up in the UI) and the ability to choose whether or not to
generate the mask from the colors.

Use Color as Mask
    This'll turn the darkest values of the image as the ones that paint,
    and the whitest as transparent. Untick this if you are using colored
    images for the brush.

We have a `Krita Brush tip
page <Special:MyLanguage/Brush-tips:Animated_Brush>`__ on how to create
your own gih brush.
