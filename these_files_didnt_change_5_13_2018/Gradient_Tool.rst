The Gradient tool is found in the Tools Panel. Left-Click dragging this
tool over the active portion of the canvas will draw out the current
gradient. If there is an active selection then, similar to the 
:doc:`Fill tool <Fill>`, the paint action will be confined to
the selection's borders.

Tool Options

Shape:

:;Linear

::This will draw the gradient straight.

:;Radial

::This will draw the gradient from a center, defined by where you start
the stroke.

:;Square

::This will draw the gradient from a center in a square shape, defined
by where you start the stroke.

:;Conical

::This will wrap the gradient around a center, defined by where you
start the stroke.

:;Conical-symmetric

::This will wrap the gradient around a center, defined by where you
start the stroke, but will mirror the wrap once.

:;Shaped

        This will shape the gradient depending on the selection or
        layer.

Repeat:

:;None

::This will extend the gradient into infinity.

:;Forward

::This will repeat the gradient into one direction.

:;Alternating

        This will repeat the gradient, alternating the normal direction
        and the reversed.

Reverse
    Reverses the direction of the gradient.
Antialias threshold
    Doesn't do anything, original function must have gotten lost in a
    port.
