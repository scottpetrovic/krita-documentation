With the Freehand Path Tool you can draw a path (much like the :doc:`shape brush <Shape>`)
the shape will then be filled with
the selected color or pattern and outlined with a brush if so chosen.
While drawing a preview line is shown that can be modified in pattern,
width and color.

This tool can be particularly good for laying in large swaths of color
quickly.
