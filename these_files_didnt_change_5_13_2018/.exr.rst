.exr
====

.exr is the prime file format for saving and loading `floating point bit
depths <Special:MyLanguage/Bit_Depth>`__, and due to the library made to
load and save these images being fully open source, the main interchange
format as well.

Floating point bit-depths are used by the computer graphics industry to
record scene referred values, which can be made via a camera or a
computer renderer. Scene referred values means that the file can have
values whiter than white, which in turn means that such a file can
record lighting conditions, such as sunsets very accurately. These exr
files can then be used inside a renderer to create realistic lighting.

Krita can load and save exr for the purpose of paint-over(yes, Krita can
paint with scene referred values) and interchange with applications like
Blender, Mari, Nuke and Natron.
