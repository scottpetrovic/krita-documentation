Paint Layers
============

Paint layers are the most commonly used type of layers used in digital
paint or image manipulation software like Krita. If you've ever used
layers in **Photoshop** or the **Gimp**, you'll be used to how they
work. In short, a paint layer, also called a pixel, bitmap or raster
layer, is a bitmap image (an image made up of many points of color).

Paint layers let you apply many advanced effects such as smearing,
smudging and distorting. This makes them the most flexible type of
layer. However, paint layers don't scale well when enlarged (they
pixelate), and any effects that have been applied can't be edited.

To deal with these two drawbacks, digital artists will typically work at
higher Pixel Per Inch (PPI) counts. It is not unusual to see PPI
settings of 400 to 600 PPI for a canvas with a good amount of detail. To
combat the issue of applied effects that cannot be edited it is best to
take advantage of the non-destructive layer capabilities of filter,
transparency and transform masks.

As long as you have enough resolution / size on your canvas though, and
as long as you aren't going to need to go back and tweak an effect you
created previously, then a paint layer is usually the type of layer you
will want. If you click on the :menuselection:`New Layer`
icon in the layers docker you'll get a paint layer. Of course you can
always choose the **New layer** dropdown to get another type.

The hotkey for adding a new paint layer is :kbd:`Ins`.
