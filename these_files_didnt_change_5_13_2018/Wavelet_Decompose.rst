Wavelet Decompose
=================

Wavelet decompose uses wavelet scales to turn the current layer into a
set of layers with each holding a different type of pattern that is
visible within the image. This is used in texture and pattern making to
remove unwanted noise quickly from a texture.

You can find it under **Layers**.

When you select it, it will ask for the amount of wavelet scales. More
scales, more different layers. Press okay, and t will generate a group
layer containing the layers with their proper blending modes:

.. figure:: images/wavelet_decompose/Wavelet_decompose.png
   :alt: images/wavelet_decompose/Wavelet_decompose.png
   :align: center

Adjust a given layer with middle gray to neutralise it, and merge
everything with the blending mode to merge it into the end image
properly.
