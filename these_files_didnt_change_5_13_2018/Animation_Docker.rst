Animation Docker
================

To have a playback of the animation, you need to
use the animation docker.

The first big box represents the current Frame. The frames are counted
with programmer's counting so they start at 0.

Then there's two boxes for you change the playback range here.So, if you
want to do a 10 frame animation, set the end to 10, and then Krita will
cycle through the frames 0 to 10.

The bar in the middle is filled with playback options, and each of these
can also be hot-keyed. The difference between a keyframe and a normal
frame in this case is that a normal frame is empty, while a keyframe is
filled.

Then, there's buttons for :menuselection:`adding, copying and removing frames`. 
More interesting is the next row:

Onion Skin
    Opens the `onion skin docker <Special:MyLanguage/Onion_Skin_Docker>`__ 
    if it wasn't open before.
Auto Frame Mode
    Will make a frame out of any empty frame you are working on.
    Currently automatically copies the previous frame.
Drop frames
    This'll drop frames if you computer isn't fast enough to show all
    frames at once. This process is automatic, but the icon will become
    red if it's forced to do this.

You can also set the speedup of the playback, which is different from
the framerate.
