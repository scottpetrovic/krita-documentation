Color Selector Settings

These settings directly affect Advanced Color Selector and Color sliders
Dockers and the same dialog box appears when the user clicks the
settings button in that docker as well. They also affect certain hotkey
actions.

This settings menu has a dropdown for Advanced Color Selector, Color
