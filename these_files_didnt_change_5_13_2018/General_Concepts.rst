General Concepts
================

General concepts is the area of the user manual where we explain general
concepts related to Krita.

These can be examples such as `colors <Special:MyLanguage/Color>`__,
`layer compositing <Special:MyLanguage/Layer_Compositing>`__,
`selections <Special:MyLanguage/Selections>`__, `Vector and
Raster <Special:MyLanguage/Vector_and_Raster>`__ and more.

The reason being that we have found that it's very difficult to expect
people to know these, and for us it's especially tricky to write pages
without having a basis to refer to.

This category is slightly different from
:doc:`tutorials <Tutorials>`, as it's more
focused on theory than on practicality and step-by-step guides.
