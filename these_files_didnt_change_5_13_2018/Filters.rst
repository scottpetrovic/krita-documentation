Filters
=======

Filters are little scripts or operations you can run on your drawing.You
can visualise them as real-world camera filters that can make a photo
darker or blurrier. Or perhaps like a coffee filter, where only water
and coffee gets through, and the ground coffee stays behind.

Filters are unique to digital painting in terms of complexity, and their
part of the painting pipeline. Some artists only use filters to adjust
their colours a little. Others, using Filter Layers and Filter Masks use
them to dynamically update a part of an image to be filtered. This way,
they can keep the original underneath without changing the original
image. This is a part of a technique called 'non-destructive' editing.

Filters can be accessed via the Filter menu. Krita has two types of
filters: Internal, and G'MIC filters.
