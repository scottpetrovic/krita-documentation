Projection
==========

The Perspective Projection tutorial is one of the Kickstarter 2015
tutorial rewards. It's about something that humanity has known
scientifically for a very long time, and decent formal training will
teach you about this. But I think there's very very few tutorials about
it in regard to how to achieve it in digital painting programs, let
alone open source.

The tutorial is a bit image heavy, and technical, but I hope the skill
it teaches will be really useful to anyone trying to get a grasp on a
complicated pose. Enjoy, and don't forget to thank
