The Calligraphy tool allows for variable width lines, with input managed
by the tablet. Press down with the stylus/left mouse button on the
canvas to make a line, lifting the stylus/mouse button ends the stroke.

.. Note::

   Krita requires Karbon to be installed on the same system to have the
   calligraphy tool available. On windows devices this is bundled, on
   Linux devices you need to make sure it's build or installed

**Fill** Doesn't actually do anything.

**Calligraphy** The dropdown menu holds your saved presets, the save
button next to it allows you to save presets.

Follow Selected Path
    If a stroke has been selected with the
    `default tool <Special:myLanguage/Krita/Manual/Tools/Default>`__,
    the calligraphy tool will follow this path.
Use Tablet Pressure
    Uses tablet pressure to control the stroke width.
Thinning
    This allows you to set how much thinner a line becomes when speeding
    up the stroke. Using a negative value makes it thicker.
Width
    Base width for the stroke.
Use Tablet Angle
    Allows you to use the tablet angle to control the stroke, only works
    for tablets supporting it.
Angle
    The angle of the dab.
Fixation
    The ratio of the dab. 1 is thin, 0 is round.
Caps
    Whether or not an stroke will end with a rounding or flat.
Mass
    How much weight the stroke has. With drag set to 0, high mass
    increase the 'orbit'.
Drag
    How much the stroke follows the cursor, when set to 0 the stroke
    will orbit around the cursor path.

.. Note::

   The calligraphy tool can be edited by the edit-line tool, but currently 
   you can't add or remove nodes without converting it to a normal path.
