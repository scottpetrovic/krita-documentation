Managing Workspaces
===================

Workspaces are basically saved configurations of dockers. Each workspace
saves how the dockers are grouped and where they are placed on the
screen. They allow you to easily move between workflows without having
to manual reconfigure your setup each time. They can be as simple or as
complex as you want.

Workspaces can only be accessed via the toolbar. There's no docker for
them. You can save workspaces, in which your current configuration is
saved. You can also import them(from a \*.kws file), or delete
them(which black lists them).

Workspaces can technically be tagged, but outside of the resource
manager this is not possible.
