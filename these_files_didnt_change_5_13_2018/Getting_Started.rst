Getting Started
===============

.. .. trying to fix the translation issue, bear with me

Welcome to the Krita Manual! In this section, we'll try to get you up to speed.

If you are familiar with digital painting, we recommend checking out the
:doc:`introduction coming from other software  <Introduction_coming_from_other_software>`
category, which contains guides that get you up to speed with Krita by
comparing its functions to other software.

If you are new to digital art, just start with
:doc:`Installation <Installation>`, which deals with
installing Krita, and continue on to
:doc:`Starting Krita <Starting_Krita>`, which helps with making a
new document and saving it, :doc:`Basic Concepts <Basic_Concepts>`,
in which we'll try to quickly cover the big categories of Krita's functionality, and finally,
:doc:`Navigation <Navigation>`, which helps you find
basic usage help, such as panning, zooming and rotating.

When you have mastered those, you can look into the dedicated
introduction pages for functionality in the `User
Manual <Special:MyLanguage/Category:User_Manual>`__, read through the
over arching concepts behind (digital) painting in the
:doc:`General Concepts <General_Concepts>` section, or
just search the :doc:`Reference Manual <Reference_Manual>`for what a
specific button does.
