Stroke Selection
================

Sometimes, you want to add an even border around a selection. Stroke
Selection allows you to do this. It's under

First make a selection and call up the menu:

.. figure:: images/stroke_selection/Krita_stroke_selection_1.png
   :alt: images/stroke_selection/Krita_stroke_selection_1.png
   :align: center

The main options are about using the current brush, or lining the
selection with an even line. You can use the current foreground color,
the background color or a custom color.

Using the current brush allows you to use textured brushes:

.. figure:: images/stroke_selection/Stroke_selection_2.png
   :alt: images/stroke_selection/Stroke_selection_2.png
   :align: center

Lining the selection also allows you to set the background color, on top
of the line width in pixels or inches:

.. figure:: images/stroke_selection/Krita_stroke_selection_3.png
   :alt: images/stroke_selection/Krita_stroke_selection_3.png
   :align: center

This creates nice silhouettes:

   :align: center
