.jpg, .jpeg or .jpeg2000 are a family of file-formats designed to encode
photographs.

Photographs have the problem that they have a lot of little gradients,
which means that you cannot index the file like you can with
:doc:`.gif` and expect the result to look good. What jpeg instead
does is that it converts the file to a perceptual color
space(\ `YCrCb <Special:MyLanguage/Color_Models>`__), and then
compresses the channels that encode the colors, while keeping the
channel that holds information about the relative lightness
uncompressed. This works really well because human eye-sight is not as
sensitive to colorfulness as it is to relative lightness.

However, it does mean that jpeg should be used in certain cases. For
images with a lot of gradients, like full scale paintings, jpeg performs
better than :doc:`.png` and :doc:`.gif`.

But for images with a lot of sharp contrasts, like text and comic book
styles, png is a much better choice despite a larger file size. For
grayscale images, png and gif will definitely be more efficient.
