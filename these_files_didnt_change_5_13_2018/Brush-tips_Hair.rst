Usually, most digital styles tend to
focus on simple brushes, like the round brushes, and their usage in hair
is no different. So, the typical example would be the one on the left,
where we use *fill\_round* to draw a silhouette and build up to lighter
values.

The reason I use *fill\_round* here is because the pressure curve on the
size is s-shaped. My tablet has a spring-loaded nib which also causes
and s-shaped curve hard-ware wise. This means that it becomes really
easy to draw thin lines and big lines. Having a trained inking hand
helps a lot with this as well, and it’s something you build up over
time.

We then gloss the shadow parties
with the *basic\_tip\_default*. So you can get really far with basic
brushes and basic painting skills and indeed I am almost convinced
tysontan, who draws our mascot, doesn’t use anything but the
*basic\_tip\_default* sometimes.

However,
if you want an easy hair brush, just take the fill\_round, go to the
brush-tip pick :menuselection:`predefined` and select
*A2-sparkle-1* as the brush tip. You can fiddle with the spacing below
the selection of predefined brushtip to space the brush, but I believe
the default should be fine enough to get result 2.
