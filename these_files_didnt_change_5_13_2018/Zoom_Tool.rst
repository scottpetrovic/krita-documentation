The zoom tool allows you to zoom your canvas in and out discretely. It
can be found at the bottom of the toolbox, and you just it by selecting
the tool, and doing on the canvas will zoom in, while will zoom out.

You can reverse this behaviour in the Tool Options.

There's a number of hotkeys associated with this tool, which makes it
easier to access from the other tools:

-  :kbd:`Ctrl + Space` ++drag on the canvas will zoom in or out fluently.
-  :kbd:`Ctrl` ++drag on the canvas will zoom in or out fluently.
-  :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt + Space` ++drag on the canvas will zoom in or out with discrete steps.
-  :kbd:`Ctrl + Alt` ++drag on the canvas will zoom in or out with discrete steps.
-  :kbd:`+` will zoom in with discrete steps.
-  :kbd:`-` will zoom out with discrete steps.
-  :kbd:`1` will set the zoom to 100%.
-  :kbd:`2` will set the zoom so that the document fits fully into the canvas area.
-  :kbd:`3` will set the zoom so that the document width fits fully into the canvas area.
