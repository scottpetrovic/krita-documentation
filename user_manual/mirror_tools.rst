Mirror Tools
============

Draw on one side of a mirror line while the Mirror Tool copies the
results to the other side. The Mirror Tools are accessed along the
toolbar. You can move the location of the mirror line by grabbing the
handle.

Mirror Tools give a simialr result to the :ref:`multibrush_tool`, but unlike the Multibrush
which only traces brush strokes like the :ref:`freehand_brush_tool`, the Mirror Tools can
be used with any other tool that traces strokes, such as the :ref:`line_tool` and the :ref:`path_tool`, and even with the
Multibrush Tool.

**Horizontal Mirror Tool** - Mirror the
results along the horizontal axis.

**Vertical Mirror Tool** - Mirror the
results along the vertical axis.

There are additional options for each tool. You can access these by the
clicking the drop-down arrow located on the right of each tool.

-  Hide Mirror Line (toggle) -- Locks the mirror axis and hides the axis
   line
-  Lock (toggle) - hides the move icon on the axis line.
-  Move to Canvas Center - Moves the axis line to the center of the
   canvas

Mirroring along a rotated line
------------------------------

The Mirror Tool can only mirror along a perfectly vertical or horizontal
line. To mirror along a line that is at a rotated angle, use the
:ref:`multibrush_tool` and its various
parameters, it has more advanced options besides basic symmetry.
