Loading and Saving Brushes
==========================

In the real world, when painting or drawing, you don't just use one
tool. You use pencils, erasers, paintbrushes, different types of paint,
inks, crayons, etcetera. All these have different ways of making marks.

In a digital program like Krita you have something similar. We call this
a brush engine. And much like how cars have different engines that give
different feels when driving, or how pencils make distinctly different
marks than rollerbal pens, different brush engines have totally
different feels.

The brush engines have a lot of different settings as well. So, you can
save those settings into presets.

Unlike Photoshop, Krita makes a difference between brush-tips and
brush-presets. Tips are only a stamp of sorts, while the preset uses a
tip and many other settings to create the full brush.

The Brush settings dropdown
---------------------------

To start, the Brush Settings Editor panel can be accessed in the
toolbar, between the Blending Modes button on the right and the Patterns
button on the left. Alternately, you can use the function key f5 to open
it.

When you open Brush Settings Editor panel you will see something like
this:

Tour of the brush settings dropdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :width: 800
   
The brush settings drop down is divided into six areas,

Section A - General Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This contains the **Preset Icon**, **Live Brush Preview**, the **Preset
Name**, the **Engine** name, and several buttons for saving, renaming,
and reloading.

Krita's brush settings are stored into the meta data of a 200x200
png(The KPP file), where the image in the png file becomes the preset
icon. The icon is used everywhere in Krita, and is useful for
differentiating brushes in ways that the live preview cannot.

The live preview shows a stroke of the current brush as a little s-curve
wiggle, with the pressure being non-existent on the left, and increasing
to full pressure as it goes to the right. The live preview can thus show
the effect of the Pressure, Drawing Angle, Distance, Fade and Fuzzy Dab
sensors, but none of the others. For some brush engines it cannot show
anything. For the color smudge, filter brush and clone tool, it shows a
alternating line pattern because these brush engines use the pixels
already on canvas to change their effect.

After the preset name, there's a button for **renaming** the brush. This
will save the brush as a new brush and blacklist the previous name.

Engine
''''''

The engine of a brush is the underlying programming that generates the
stroke from a brush. What that means is that different brush engines
have different options and different results. You can see this as the
difference between using crayons, pencils and inks, but because
computers are maths devices, most of our brush engines produce different
things in a more mathematical way.

For most artists the mathematical nature doesn't matter as much as the
different textures and marks each brush engine, and each brush engine
has it's own distinct flavor and use, and can be further customized by
modifying the options.

Reloading
'''''''''

If you change a preset, an icon will appear behind the engine name. This
is the reload button. You can use it to revert to the original brush
settings.

Saving a preset.
''''''''''''''''

On the right, there's {MenuChoice\|Save New Preset}} and .

Overwrite Preset
    This will only enable if there's any changes. Pressing this will
    override the current preset with the new settings, keeping the name
    and the icon intact. It will always make a timestamped back up in
    the resources folder.
Save New Preset
    Will take the current preset and all it's changes and save it as a
    new preset. If no change was made, you will be making a copy of the
    current preset.

Save new preset will call up the following window, with a mini scratch
pad, and all sorts of options to change the preset icon:

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_Save_New_Brush_Preset_Dialog.png

The image on the left is a mini scratchpad, you can draw on it with the
current brush, allowing small modifications on the fly.

Brush Name
    The Name of your brush. This is also used for the KPP file. If
    there's already a brush with that name, it will effectively
    overwrite it.
Load Existing Thumbnail
    This will load the existing thumbnail inside the preset.
Load scratch pad thumbnail
    This will load the dashed area from the big scratch pad(Section C)
    into the thumbnail area.
Load Image
    With this you can choose an image from disk to load as a thumbnail.
Load from Icon Library
    This opens up the icon library.
Clear Thumbnail
    This will make the mini scratch pad white.

The Icon Library
''''''''''''''''

To make making presets icons faster, we added a icon library to Krita

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_Preset_Icon_Library_Dialog.png

It allows you to select tool icons, and an optional small emblem. When
you press OK it will load the resulting combination into the mini
scratch pad and you can draw in the stroke.

If you go to your resources folder(), there's a folder there called
“preset\_icons”, and in this folder there's “tool\_icons” and
“emblem\_icons”. You can add semi-transparent pngs here and Krita will
load those into the icon library as well so you can customize your icons
even more!

At the top right of the icon library, there's three sliders. They allow
you to adjust the tool icon. The top two are the same Hue and Saturation
as in HSL adjustment, ad the lowest slider is a super simple levels
filter. This is done this way because the levels filter allows
maintaining the darkest shadows and brightest highlights on a tool icon,
making it much better for quick adjustments.

If you're done with everything, you can press save in the Save New
Preset dialog and Krita will save the new brush.

Section B - The Preset Chooser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The preset chooser is much the same like the preset docker and the
preset dropdown on F6. It's unique in that it allows you to filter by
engine and this is also where you can create brushes for an engine from
scratch.

It is by default collapsed, so you will need to press the arrow at the
top left of the brush engine to show it.

The top drop down is set to “all” by default, which means it shows all
engines. It then shows a tag section where you can select the tags, the
preset list and the search bar.

Underneath that there's a plus icon, which when pressed gives you the
full list of Krita's engines. Selecting an engine from the list will for
that engine.

The trashcan icon does the same as it does in the preset docker: , or
rather, blacklist a preset so it won't show up in the list.

Section C - The Scratch pad
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you tweak your brushes, you want to be able to check what each
setting does. That's why, to the right of the settings drop down, there
is a scratch pad.

It is by default collapsed, so you will have to press the arrow at the
top right of the brush settings to show it.

When saving a new preset, you can choose to get the icon from the
scratch pad, this will load the dash area into the mini scratch pad of
the Save New Preset dialog.

The scratch pad has five buttons underneath it. These are in order for:

#. showing the current brush image

#. adding a gradient to the scratch pad(useful for smudge brushes)
#. filling with the background color
#. clearing everything on the scratch pad.

Section D - The Options List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The options, as stated above, are different per brush engine. These
represent the different parameters, toggles and knobs that you can turn
to make a brush preset unique. For a couple of options, the main things
to change are sliders and check boxes, but for a lot of them, they use
curves instead.

Some options can be toggled, as noted by the little check boxes next to
them, but others, like flow and opacity are so fundamental to how the
brush works, that they are always on.

The little padlock icon next to the options is for locking the brush.
This has its own page.

Section E - Option Configuration Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Where section D is the list of options, section E is the widget where
you can change things.

Using sensor curves
'''''''''''''''''''

One of the big important things that makes art unique to the artist who
created it is the style of the strokes. Strokes are different because
they differ in speed, rotation, direction, and the amount of pressure
put onto the stylus. Because these are so important, we would want to
customize how these values are understood in detail. The best way to do
this is to use curves.

Curves show up with the size widget for example. With an inking brush,
we want to have size mapped to pressure. Just toggling the size option
in the option list will do that.

However, different people have different wrists and thus will press
differently on their stylus. Someone who presses softly tends to find it
easy to make thin strokes, but very difficult to make thick strokes.
Conversely, someone who presses hard on their stylus naturally will have
a hard time making thin strokes, but easily makes thick ones.

Such a situation can be improve by using the curves to map pressure to
output thinner lines or thicker ones.

The brush settings curves even have quick curve buttons for these at the
top. Someone who has a hard time making small strokes should try the
second to last concave button, while someone who has a hard time making
thick strokes should try the third button, the S shape.

Underneath the curve widget there's two more options:

Share Curves across all settings
    This is for the list of sensors. Toggling this will make all the
    sensors use the same curve. Untoggled, all toggled sensors will have
    seperate curves.
Curves Calculation Mode
    This indicates how the multiple values of the sensor curves are
    used. The curves always go from 0 to 1.0, so if one curve outputs
    0.5 and the other 0.7, then...

    Multiply
        will multiply the two values, 0.5\*0.7 = 0.35
    Addition
        will add the the two to a maximum of 1.0, so 0.5+0.7 = 1.2,
        which is then capped at 1.0.
    Maximum
        Will compare the two and pick the largest. So in the case of 0.5
        and 0.7, the result is 0.7.
    Minimum
        Will compare the two and pick the smallest. So in the case of
        0.5 and 0.7, the result is 0.5.
    Difference
        Will subtract the smallest value from the largest, so 0.7-0.5 =
        0.2

It's maybe better to see with the following example:

.. image:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_brush_curve_calculation_mode.png

The first two are regular, the rest with different multiplication types.

#. Is a brush with size set to the distance sensor.
#. Is a brush with the size set to the fade sensor.
#. The size is calculated from the fade and distance sensors multiplied.
#. The size is calculated from the fade and distance sensors added to
   each other. Notice how thick it is.
#. The size takes the maximum value from the values of the fade and
   distance sensors.
#. The size takes the minimum value from the values of the face and
   distance sensors.
#. The size is calculated by having the largest of the values subtracted
   with the smallest of the values.

Section F - Miscellaneous options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Temporarily Save Tweaks to Preset (Dirty Presets)
    This enables dirty presets. Dirty presets store the tweaks you make
    as long as this session of Krita is active. After that, the revert
    to default. Dirtied presets can be recognized by the icon in the
    top-left of the preset. 
    
    .. figure:: /images/en/Krita_4_0_dirty_preset_icon.png
       :figwidth: 450
        
       The icon in the top left of the first two presets indicate it is “Dirty”, meaning there's tweaks made to the preset.

Eraser Switch Size
    This switches the brush to a separately stored size when using the
    eraserE key.
Eraser Switch Opacity
    Same as above, but then with Eraser opacity.
Instant Preview
    This allows you to toggle instant preview on the brush. The Instant
    Preview has a super-secret feature: when you press the instant
    preview label, and then right click it, it will show a threshold
    slider. This slider determines at what brush size instant preview is
    activated for the brush. This is useful because small brushes can be
    slower with instant preview, so the threshold ensures it only
    activates when necessary.

The On-canvas brush settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are on-canvas brush settings. If you open up the pop-up palette,
there should be an icon on the bottom-right. Press that to show the
on-canvas brush settings. You will see several sliders here, to quickly
make small changes.

At the top it shows the currently active preset. Next to that is a
settings button, click that to get a list of settings that can be shown
and organized for the given brush engine. You can use the up and down
arrows to order their position, and then left and right arrows to add or
remove from the list. You can also drag and drop.

Making a Brush Preset
---------------------

Now, let's make a simple brush to test the waters with:

Getting a default for the brush engine.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, open the settings with F5.

Then, press the arrow on the upper left to open the preset chooser.
There, press the “+” icon to get a list of engines. For this brush we're
gonna make a pixel brush.

Example: Making an inking brush
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Draw on the scratch pad to see what the current brush looks like. If
   done correctly you should have a 5px wide brush that has pressure set
   to opacity.
#. Let us turn off the opacity first. Click on the
   :ref:`opacity <option_opacity_n_flow>`
   option in the right-hand list. The settings should now be changed to
   a big curve. This is the sensor curve.
#. Untick the enable pen settings button.
#. Test on the scratch pad... there still seems to be something
   affecting opacity. This is due the
   :ref:`flow <option_opacity_n_flow>`
   option.
#. Select the Flow option from the list on the right hand. Flow is like
   Opacity, except that Flow is per dab, and opacity is per stroke.
#. Turn off the enable pen settings button here as well. Test again.
#. Now you should be getting somewhere towards an inking brush. It is
   still too small however, and kinda grainy looking. Click :ref:`Brush Tip <option_brush_tip>` in the
   brush engine options.
#. Here, diameter is the size of the brush-tip. You can touch the slider
   change the size, or right-click it and type in a value. Set it to 25
   and test again. It should be much better.
#. Now to make the brush feel a bit softer, turn down the fade parameter
   to about 0.9. This'll give the *brush mask* a softer edge.
#. If you test again, you'll notice the fade doesn't seem to have much
   effect. This has to do with the spacing of the dabs: The closer they
   are together, the harder the line is. By default this is 0.1, which
   is a bit low. If you set it to 10 and test, you'll see what kind of
   effect spacing has. The
   :ref:`Auto <option_spacing>`
   tickbox changes the way the spacing is calculated, and Auto Spacing
   with a value of 0.8 is the best value for inking brushes. Don't
   forget that you can use right-click to type in a value.
#. Now, when you test, the fade seems to have a normal effect... except
   on the really small sizes, which look pixelly. To get rid of that,
   tick the anti-aliasing check box. If you test again, the lines should
   be much nicer now.

Saving the new Brush
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you're satisfied, go to the upper left and select “save new
preset”.

You will get the save preset dialog. Name the brush something like “My
Preset”. Then, select “Load from Icon Library” to get the icon library.
Choose a nice tool icon and press OK.

The icon will be loaded into the mini scratch pad on the left. Now
doodle a nice stroke next to it. If you feel you messed up, just go back
to the icon library to load a new icon.

Finally press “save”, and your brush should be done.

You can further modify your inking brush by...

Changing the amount of pressure you need to put on a brush to make it full size.
    To do this, select the :ref:`size <option_size>`
    option, and press the pressuresensor from the list next to the curve. The curve should look like a straight line. Now if you want a brush that gets big with little pressure, tick on the curve to make a point, and drag the point to the upper-left. The more the point is to the upper-left, the more extreme the effect. If you want instead a brush that you have to press really hard on to get to full size, drag the dot to the lower-right. Such a brush is useful for fine details. Don't forget to save the changes to your brush when done.
Making the fine lines look even softer by using the flow option.
    To do this, select the flow option, and turn back on the enable pen settings check box. Now if you test this, it is indeed a bit softer, but maybe a bit too much. Click on the curve to make a dot, and drag that dot to the top-left, half-way the horizontal of the first square of the grid. Now, if you test, the thin lines are much softer, but the hard your press, the harder the brush becomes.

Sharing Brushes
---------------

Okay, so you've made a new brush and want to share it. There's several
ways to share a brush preset.

The recommended way to share brushes and presets is by using the
resource bundle system. We have detailed instructions on how to use them
on the :ref:`resource management page <resource_management>`.

However, there's various old-fashioned ways of sharing brushes that can
be useful when importing and loading very old packs:

Sharing a single preset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There's three types of resources a single preset can take:

#. A Paintoppreset file: This is the preset proper, with the icon and
   the curves stored inside.
#. A Brush file: This is the brush tip. When using masked brushes,
   there's two of these.
#. A Pattern file: this is when you are using textures.

So when you have a brush that uses unique predefined tips for either
brush tip or masked brush, or unique textures you will need to share
those resources as well with the other person.

To find those resources, go to .

There, the preset file will be inside paintoppresets, the brush tips
inside brushes and the texture inside patterns.

Importing a single KPP file.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, if you want to use the single preset, you should go to the preset
chooser on f6 and press the folder icon there. This will give a file
dialog. Navigate to the kpp file and open it to import it.

If there's brush tips and patterns coming with the file, do the same
with pattern via the pattern docker, and for the brush-tip go to the
settings dropdown(f5) and then go to the “brush-tip” option. There,
select predefined brush, and then the “import” button to call up the
file dialog.

Sharing via ZIP(old fashioned)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sharing via ZIP should be replaced with resource bundles, but older
brush packs are strored in zip files.

Using a ZIP with the relevant files.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Go to to open the resource folder.
#. Then, open up the zip file.
#. Copy the brushes, paintoppresets and patterns folders from the zip
   file to the resource folder. You should get a prompt to merge the
   folders, agree to this.
#. Restart Krita
#. Enjoy your brushes!
