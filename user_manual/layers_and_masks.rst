Introduction to Layers and Masks
================================

Krita supports layers which help to better control parts and elements of
your painting.

Think of an artwork or collage made with various stacks of papers with
some paper cut such that they show the paper beneath them while some
hide what's beneath them. If you want to replace an element in the
artwork, you replace that piece of paper instead of drawing the entire
thing. In Krita instead of papers we use **Layers**. Layers are part of
the document which may or may not be transparent, they may be smaller or
bigger than the document itself, they can arrange one above other, named
and grouped.

Layers can give better control over your artwork for example you can
re-color an entire artwork just by working on the separate color layer
and thereby not destroying the line art which will reside above this
color layer.

You can edit individual layers, you can even add special effects to
them, like Layer styles, blending modes, transparency, filters and
transforms. Krita takes all these layers in its layer stack, including
the special effects and combines or composites together a final image.
This is just one of the many digital image manipulation tricks that
**Krita** has up it's sleeve!

Usually, when you put one paint layer on top of another, the upper paint
layer will be fully visible, while the layer behind it will either be
obscured, occluded or only partially visible.

Managing layers
---------------

Some artists draw with limited number of layers but some prefer to have
different elements of the artwork on separate layer. Krita has some good
layer management features which make the layer management task easy.

You can :ref:`group layers <group_layers>` and organise
the elements of your artwork.

The layer order can be changed or layers can be moved in and out of a
group in the layer stack by simply holding them and dragging and
dropping. Layers can also be copied across documents while in the
:ref:`subwindow mode <window_settings>`, by
dragging and dropping from one document to another.

These features save time and also help artists in maintaining the file
with a layer stack which will be easy to understand for others who work
on the same file. In addition to this layers and groups can both be
labelled and filtered by colors, thus helping the artists to visually
differentiate them.

To assign a color label to your layer or layer group you have to right
click on the layer and choose one of the given colors from the context
menu. To remove an already existing color label you can click on the 'x'
marked box in the context menu.

Once you assign color labels to your layers, you can then filter layers
having similar color label by clicking on one or more colors in the list
from the drop-down situated at the top-right corner of the layer docker

Types of Layers
---------------

.. image:: /images/en/500px-Krita-types-of-layers.png

The image above shows the various types of layers in `layer
docker <Special:MyLanguage/Layers>`__, Each layer type has a different
purpose for example all the vector elements can be only placed on a
vector layer and similarly normal raster elements are mostly on the
paint layer, `Layers and
masks <Special:MyLanguage/category:Layers_and_Masks>`__ page contains
more information about these types layers

Now Let us see how these layers are composited in krita

How are layers composited in Krita ?
------------------------------------

In Krita, the visible layers form a composite image which is shown on
the canvas. The order in which Krita composites the layers is from
bottom to top, much like the stack of papers we discussed above. As we
continue adding layers, the image we see changes, according to the
properties of the newly added layers on top. Group Layers composite
separately from the other layers in the stack, except when pass through
mode is activated. The layers inside a group form a composite image
first and then this composite is taken into consideration while the
layer stack is composited to form a whole image. If the pass through
mode is activated by pressing the icon similar to bricked wall, the
layers within the group are considered as if they are outside of that
particular group in the layer stack, however, the visibility of the
layers in a group depends on the visibility of the group.

The groups in a PSD file saved from Photoshop have pass-through mode on
by default unless they are specifically set with other blending modes.

.. index:: Alpha Inheritance, Clipping Masks

Inherit Alpha or Clipping layers
--------------------------------

There is a clipping feature in Krita called inherit alpha. It is denoted
by an alpha icon in the layer stack. 

.. image:: /images/en/Inherit-alpha-02.png

It can be somewhat hard to figure out how the inherit alpha feature
works in Krita for the first time. Once you click on the inherit alpha
icon on the layer stack, the pixels of the layer you are painting on are
confined to the combined pixel area of all the layers below it. That
means if you have the default white background layer as first layer,
clicking on the inherit alpha icon and painting on any layer above will
seem to have no effect as the entire canvas is filled with white. Hence,
it is advised to put the base layer that you want the pixels to clip in
a group layer. As mentioned above, group layers are composited
separately, hence the layer which is the lowest layer in a group becomes
the bounding layer and the content of the layers above this layer clips
to it if inherit alpha is enabled.

.. image:: /images/en/Inherit-alpha-krita.jpg

You can also enable alpha inheritance to a group layer.

Masks and Filters
-----------------

Krita supports non-destructive editing of the content of the layer.
Non-destructive editing means editing or changing a layer or image
without actually changing the original source image permanently, the
changes are just added as filters or masks over the original image while
keeping it intact, this helps a lot when your workflow requires constant
back and forth. You can go back to original image with a click of a
button, Just hide the filter or mask you have your initial image.

You can add various filters to a layer with Filter mask, or add Filter
layer which will affect the whole image. You can transform the layers
non-destructively by adding Transform masks, You can also hide portions
of the layer by adding a Transparency mask instead of permanently
erasing it and if you change your mind you can unhide this portion later
at any point.

.. note::
    You can merge all visible layers by selecting everything first :menuselection:`Layer --> Select --> Visible Layers`. Then Combine them all by merging :menuselection:`Layer --> Merge with Layer Below`.

These filters and masks are accessible through the right click menu (as
shown in the image below) and the Plus icon on the layer docker.

.. image:: /images/en/Layer-right-click.png

You can also add a filter as a mask from filter dialog itself, by
clicking on the Create Filter Mask button.

.. image:: /images/en/Filtermask-button.png

All the filters and masks can also be applied over a group too, thus
making it easy to non-destructively edit multiple layers at once. In the
:ref:`category Layers and
masks <cat_layers_and_masks>` you can read
more about the individual types of layers and masks.

:ref:`Layer Docker <layer_docker>` has more information about
the shortcuts and other layer management workflows.
