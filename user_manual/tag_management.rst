Tag Management
==============

Tags are how you organize common types of resources. Tags can be used with brushes, gradients, patterns, and even brush tips. Tags are usually selected from a drop-down menu above the resources. Selecting a tag will filter all of the resources by that tag. Selecting the tag of "All" will show all resources.  Krita comes installed with a few default tags. You can create and edit your own as well. The tags are managed in a similar way across the different types of resources.

You can use tags together with the :ref:`Pop-up Palette <navigation>` for increased productivity.

    You can select different brush tags in the pop-up palette. This can be a quick way to access your favorite brushes.
