Installation
============

Windows
-------

Windows users can download the latest releases from our
`website. <https://krita.org/download/krita-desktop>`__\ Click on 64bit
or 32bit according to the architecture of your OS. Go to the
`KDE <http://download.kde.org/stable/krita/>`__ download directory to
get the portable zip-file version of Krita instead of the setup.exe
installer.

.. warning:: 
   Krita requires Windows Vista or newer. 
   INTEL GRAPHICS CARD USERS: IF YOU SEE A BLACK OR BLANK WINDOW: UPDATE YOUR DRIVERS!

Linux
-----

Many Linux distributions package the latest version of Krita. Sometimes
you will have to enable an extra repository. Krita runs fine under on
desktop: KDE, Gnome, LXDE -- even though it is a KDE SC application and
needs the KDE libraries. You might also want to install the KDE
systemsettings module and tweak the gui theme and fonts used, depending
on your distributions

Nautilus/Nemo file extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Put here at the beginning, before we start on the many distro specific
ways to get the program itself.

Since April 2016, KDE's Dolphin will show kra and ora thumbnails by
default, but Nautilus and it's derivatives will need an extension. `We
recommend Moritz Molch's extensions for XCF, KRA, ORA and PSD
thumbnails <http://moritzmolch.com/1749>`__.

Appimages
~~~~~~~~~

For Krita 3.0 and later, first try out the appimage from the website
first. **90% of the time this is by far the easiest way to get the
latest Krita.** Just download the appimage, and then use the file
properties or the bash command chmod to make the appimage executable.
Double click it, and enjoy Krita. (Or run it in the terminal with
./appimagename.appimage)

::

 # open this terminal into the folder you have the appimage
 # make it executable''
 chmod a+x krita-3.0-x86_64.appimage
 
 # run Krita!
 ./krita-3.0-x86_64.appimage

Appimages are ISOs with all the necessary libraries inside, meaning no
fiddling with repositories and dependencies, at the cost of a slight bit
more diskspace taken up(And this size would only be bigger if you were
using Plasma to begin with).

Ubuntu and Kubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It does not matter which version of Ubuntu you use, Krita will run just
fine. However, by default, only a very old version of Krita is
available. You should either use the appimage, or the snap available
from Ubuntu's app store.

OpenSUSE
~~~~~~~~

The most latest stable builds are available from KDE:Extra repo:

-  http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/KDE:/Extra/

.. note::
   Krita is also in the official repos as *calligra-krita* , you can install it from Yast.

Fedora
~~~~~~

Krita is in the official repos as **calligra-krita** , you can install
it by using packagekit (Add/Remove Software ) or by writing the command
below in terminal ``yum install calligra-krita`` Or
``dnf install calligra-krita`` if you are using fedora 22.

Debian
~~~~~~

The latest version of Krita available in Debian is 2.6. Jessie (stable)
has 2.8.5+dfsg-1+b2.

Arch
~~~~

Arch Linux provides krita package in the Extra repository. You can
install Krita by using the command below ``pacman -S krita`` You can
install the most recent build of Krita using Yaourt repository with the
help of command below ``yaourt -S krita-git``

OS X
----

.. warning::
   Mac OSX is very experimental right now and unstable, don't use it for production purpose

You can download the latest binary if you want from our
`website <https://krita.org/download/krita-desktop/>`__. It has only
been reported to work with Mac OSX 10.9.

Source
------

While it is certainly more difficult to compile Krita from source than
it is to install from prebuilt packages, there are certain advantages
that might make the effort worth it:

-  You can follow the development of Krita on the foot. If you compile
   Krita regularly from the development repository, you will be able to
   play withall the new features that the developers are working on.
-  You can compile optimized for your processor. Most pre-built packages
   are built for the lowest-common denominator.
-  You will be getting all the bug fixes as soon as possible as well.
-  You can help the developers by giving us your feedback on features as
   they are being developed and you can test bug fixes for us. This is
   hugely important, which is why our regular testers get their name in
   the about box just like developers.

Of course, there are also disadvantages: when building from the current
development source repository you also get all the unfinished features.
It might mean less stability for a while, or things shown in the user
interface that don't work. But in practice, there seldom is really bad
instability, and if it is, it's easy for you to go back to a revision
that does work.

So... If you want to start compiling from source, begin with the latest
build instructions from the excellent illustrated
`guide <http://www.davidrevoy.com/article193/guide-building-krita-on-linux-for-cats>`__
by David Revoy.

There is more information and troubleshooting help on the
`Calligra <https://community.kde.org/Calligra/Building>`__ wiki:

If you encounter any problems, or if you are new to compiling software,
don't hesitate to contact the Krita developers. There are three main
communication channels:

-  irc: irc.freenode.net, channel #krita
-  `mailing list <https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kimageshop>`__
-  `forums <http://forum.kde.org/viewforum.php?f=136>`__
