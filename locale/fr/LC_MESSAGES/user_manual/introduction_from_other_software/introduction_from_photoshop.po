"This document gives an introduction to Krita for users who have been "
"using PhotoShop. The intention is to make you productive in Krita as fast"
" as possible and ease the conversion of old habits into new ones. This "
"introduction is written with Krita version 2.9 and Photoshop CS2 and CS3 "
"in mind. But even though things may change in the future, the basics will"
" most likely remain the same. The first thing to remember is that Krita "
"is a 2D paint application while Photoshop (PS) is an image manipulation "
"program. This means that PS has more features than Krita in general, but "
"Krita has the tools that are relevant to digital painting. When you get "
"used to Krita, you will find that Krita has some features that are not "
"part of PS."
