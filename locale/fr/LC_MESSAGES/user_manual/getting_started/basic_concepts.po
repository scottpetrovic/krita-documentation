"In digital imaging, a pixel (Picture Element) is a basic and lowest "
"element of an Image. It is basically a grid of points each displaying "
"specific color. Raster editing is manipulating and editing these pixels. "
"For example when you take a 1-pixel brush which is colored black and "
"painting on the white canvas in Krita you are actually changing the color"
" of the pixel beneath your brush from white to black.When you zoom in and"
" see a brush stroke you can notice many small squares with colors, these "
"are pixels"

"In contrast, vector graphic work is based on mathematical expressions. "
"They are independent of the pixel. For example, when you draw a rectangle"
" on a vector layer in Krita you are actually drawing paths passing "
"through points called nodes which are located on specific co-ordinates on"
" the 'x' and 'y' axes. When you re-size or move these points the computer"
" calculates and redraws the path and displays the newly formed shape to "
"you. Hence you can re-size the vector shape to any extent without any "
"loss in quality."
