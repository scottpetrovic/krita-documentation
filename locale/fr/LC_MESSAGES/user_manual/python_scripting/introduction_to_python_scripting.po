"When we offered python scripting as one of Kickstarter Stretchgoals we "
"could implement next to vectors and text, it won the backer vote by a "
"landslide. Some people even only picked python and nothing else. So what "

"Python is a scripting language, that can be used to automate tasks. What "
"python scripting in Krita means is that we added an API to krita, which "
"is a bit of programming that allows python to access to parts of Krita. "
"With this we can make dockers, perform menial tasks on a lot of different"
" files and even write our own exporters. People who work with computer "
"graphics, like VFX and video game artists use python a lot to make things"
" like sprite sheets, automate parts of export and more."

"It is outside the scope of this manual to teach you python itself. "

"The scripter plugin is not necessary to use python, but it is very useful"

"But what if you want to write new commands for yourself? The best place "

" can save a lot of time if someone else has written code that you can "

"Those pages may look like a lot of jargon at first. This is because "
"Krita's API documentation comes from the underlying C++ language that "
"Krita is written in. The magic happens because of a Python tool called "
"SIP, which makes it possible for python speak in C++ and talk to Krita. "

"One of the more confusing things is seeing all the C++ classes that Krita"
" uses, including the Qt classes that start with Q. But here is the beauty"
" fo SIP: it tries to make the translation from these classes into Python "
"as simple and straightforward as possible. For example, you can see that "
"the function filters() returns a QStringList. However, SIP converts those"
" QStringLists into regular python list of strings!"
