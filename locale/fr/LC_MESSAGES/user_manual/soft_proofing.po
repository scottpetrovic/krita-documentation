msgid ""
"When we make an image in Krita, and print that out with a printer, the "
"image tends to look different. The colours are darker, or less dark than "
"expected, maybe the reds are more aggressive, maybe contrast is lost. For"
" simple documents, this isn’t much of a problem, but for professional "
"prints, this can be very sad, as it can change the look and feel of an "
"image drastically."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:19
msgid ""
"The reason this happens is simply because the printer uses a different "
"color model(CMYK) and it has often access to a lower range of "
"colors(called a gamut)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:21
msgid ""
"A naive person would suggest the following solution: do your work within "
"the CMYK color model! But there’s three problems with that:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:23
msgid ""
"Painting in a CMYK space doesn’t guarantee that the colors will be the "
"same on your printer. For each combination of Ink, Paper and Printing "
"device, the resulting gamut of colors you can use is different. Which "
"means that each of these could have a different profile associated with "
"them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:24
msgid ""
"Furthermore, even if you have the profile and are working in the exact "
"color space that your printer can output, the CMYK color space is very "
"irregular, meaning that the color maths isn’t as nice as in other spaces."
" Blending modes are different in CMYK as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:25
msgid ""
"Finally, working in that specific CMYK space means that the image is "
"stuck to that space. If you are preparing your work for  different a CMYK"
" profile, due the paper, printer or ink being different, you might have a"
" bigger gamut with more bright colors that you would like to take "
"advantage of."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/soft_proofing.rst:27
msgid ""
"So ideally, you would do the image in RGB, and use all your favourite RGB"
" tools, and let the computer do a conversion to a given CMYK space on the"
" fly, just for preview. This is possible, and is what we call ''Soft "
"Proofing''."

"On the left, the original, on the right, a view where soft proofing is "
"turned on. The difference is subtle due to the lack of really bright "
"colors, but the softproofed version is slightly less blueish in the "
"whites of the flowers and slightly less saturated in the greens of the "
"leaves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can toggle soft proofing on any image using :kbd:`Ctrl + Y`. Unlike "
"other programs, this is per-view, so that you can look at your image non-"
"proofed and proofed, side by side. The settings are also per image, and "
"saved into the .kra file. You can set the proofing options in "
":menuselection:`image --> image properties --> Soft Proofing`."

"Of these, only the profile is really important. This will serve as the "

"A feature which allows you to set whether :guilabel:`Absolute "
