"Drawing with a mouse can be unintuitive and difficult compared to pencil "
"and paper. Even worse, extended mouse use can result in carpal tunnel "
"syndrome. That’s why most people who draw digitally use a specialized "
"piece of hardware known as a drawing tablet."

"A drawing tablet is a piece of hardware that you can plug into your "
"machine, much like a keyboard or mouse. It usually looks like a plastic "
"pad, with a stylus. Another popular format is a computer monitors with "
"stylus used to draw directly on the screen. These are better to use than "
"a mouse because it’s more natural to draw with a stylus and generally "
"better for your wrists."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/drawing_tablets.rst:39
msgid ""
"With a properly installed tablet stylus, Krita can use information like "
"pressure sensitivity, allowing you to make strokes that get bigger or "
"smaller depending on the pressure you put on them, to create richer and "
"more interesting strokes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/drawing_tablets.rst:45
msgid ""
"Sometimes, people confuse finger-touch styluses with a proper tablet. You"
" can tell the difference because a drawing tablet stylus usually has a "
"pointy nib, while a stylus made for finger-touch has a big rubbery round "
"nib, like a finger. These tablets may not give good results and a "
"pressure-sensitive tablet is recommended."

"So you have bought a tablet, a real drawing tablet. And you wanna get it "
"to work with Krita! so you plug in the USB cable, start up Krita and... "
"it doesn’t work! Or well, you can make strokes, but that pressure "
"sensitivity you heard so much about doesn’t seem to work."
msgstr ""

"This is because you need to install a program called a ‘driver’. Usually "
"you can find the driver on a CD that was delivered alongside your tablet,"
" or on the website of the manufacturer. Go install it, and while you "
"wait, we’ll go into the details of what it is!"

"Running on your computer is a basic system doing all the tricky bits of "
"running a computer for you. This is the operating system, or OS. Most "
"people use an operating system called Windows, but people on an Apple "
"device have an operating system called MacOS, and some people, including "
"many of the developers use a system called Linux."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/drawing_tablets.rst:68
msgid ""
"The base principle of all of these systems is the same though. You would "
"like to run programs like Krita, called software, on your computer, and "
"you want Krita to be able to communicate with the hardware, like your "
"drawing tablet. But to have those two communicate can be really difficult"
" - so the operating system, works as a glue between the two."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/drawing_tablets.rst:74

"Whenever you start Krita, Krita will first make connections with the "
"operating system, so it can ask it for a lot of these things: It would "
"like to display things, and use the memory, and so on. Most importantly, "
"it would like to get information from the tablet!"

"But it can’t! Turns out your operating system doesn’t know much about "
"tablets. That’s what drivers are for. Installing a driver gives the "
"operating system enough information so the OS can provide Krita with the "
"right information about the tablet. The hardware manufacturer's job is to"
" write a proper driver for each operating system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/drawing_tablets.rst:88
msgid ""
"Because drivers modify the operating system a little, you will always "
"need to restart your computer when installing or deinstalling a driver, "
"so don’t forget to do this! Conversely, because Krita isn’t a driver, you"
" don’t need to even deinstall it to reset the configuration, just rename "
"or delete the configuration file."

"Certain tablets using n-trig, like the Surface Pro, have two types of "
"drivers. N-trig by default only has Windows Ink drivers, but Krita "

#: ../../user_manual/drawing_tablets.rst:117
msgid ""
"Tablet drivers need to be made by the manufacturer. Sometimes, with "
"really cheap tablets, the hardware is fine, but the driver is badly "
"written, which means that the driver just doesn’t work well. We cannot do"
" anything about this, sadly. You will have to sent a complaint to the "

"On Windows, you can only have a single wintab-style driver installed at a"

"Sometimes, there's software that tries to make a security layer between "
"Krita and the operating system. Sandboxie is an example of this. However,"
" Krita cannot always connect to certain parts of the operating system "
"while sandboxed, so it will often break in programs like sandboxie. "
"Similarly, certain mouse software, like Razer utilities can also affect "
"whether Krita can talk to the operating system, converting tablet "
"information to mouse information. This type of software should be "
"configured to leave Krita alone, or be deinstalled."

#: ../../user_manual/drawing_tablets.rst:156
msgid ""
"If you have a situation where trying to draw keeps bringing up the pop-up"
" palette on windows, then the problem might be flicks. These are a type "
"of gesture, a bit of windows functionality that allows you to make a "
"motion to serve as a keyboard shortcut. Windows automatically turns these"
" on when you install tablet drivers, because the people who made this "
"part of windows forgot that people also draw with computers. So you will "
"need to turn it off in the windows flicks configuration."
