"Think of an artwork or collage made with various stacks of papers with "
"some paper cut such that they show the paper beneath them while some hide"
" what's beneath them. If you want to replace an element in the artwork, "
"you replace that piece of paper instead of drawing the entire thing. In "
"Krita instead of papers we use **Layers**. Layers are part of the "
"document which may or may not be transparent, they may be smaller or "
"bigger than the document itself, they can arrange one above other, named "
"and grouped."

"Layers can give better control over your artwork for example you can re-"
"color an entire artwork just by working on the separate color layer and "
"thereby not destroying the line art which will reside above this color "
"layer."

"You can edit individual layers, you can even add special effects to them,"
" like Layer styles, blending modes, transparency, filters and transforms."
" Krita takes all these layers in its layer stack, including the special "
"effects and combines or composites together a final image. This is just "
"one of the many digital image manipulation tricks that **Krita** has up "
"it's sleeve!"

"The layer order can be changed or layers can be moved in and out of a "

"one document to another."

"These features save time and also help artists in maintaining the file "

"differentiate them."

"In Krita, the visible layers form a composite image which is shown on the"
" canvas. The order in which Krita composites the layers is from bottom to"
" top, much like the stack of papers we discussed above. As we continue "
"adding layers, the image we see changes, according to the properties of "
"the newly added layers on top. Group Layers composite separately from the"
" other layers in the stack, except when pass through mode is activated. "
"The layers inside a group form a composite image first and then this "
"composite is taken into consideration while the layer stack is composited"
" to form a whole image. If the pass through mode is activated by pressing"
" the icon similar to bricked wall, the layers within the group are "
"considered as if they are outside of that particular group in the layer "
"stack, however, the visibility of the layers in a group depends on the "
"visibility of the group."

msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/layers_and_masks.rst:134
msgid ""
"It can be somewhat hard to figure out how the inherit alpha feature works"
" in Krita for the first time. Once you click on the inherit alpha icon on"
" the layer stack, the pixels of the layer you are painting on are "
"confined to the combined pixel area of all the layers below it. That "
"means if you have the default white background layer as first layer, "
"clicking on the inherit alpha icon and painting on any layer above will "
"seem to have no effect as the entire canvas is filled with white. Hence, "
"it is advised to put the base layer that you want the pixels to clip in a"
" group layer. As mentioned above, group layers are composited separately,"
" hence the layer which is the lowest layer in a group becomes the "
"bounding layer and the content of the layers above this layer clips to it"
" if inherit alpha is enabled."

"Krita supports non-destructive editing of the content of the layer. Non-"
"destructive editing means editing or changing a layer or image without "
"actually changing the original source image permanently, the changes are "
"just added as filters or masks over the original image while keeping it "
"intact, this helps a lot when your workflow requires constant back and "
"forth. You can go back to original image with a click of a button, Just "
"hide the filter or mask you have your initial image."

"You can add various filters to a layer with Filter mask, or add Filter "
