":program:`Krita`, as a painting program, juggles a lot of data around, "
"like the brushes you use, the colours you picked, but primarily, each "
"pixel in your image. Due to this, how :program:`Krita` organises where it"
" stores all the data can really speed up :program:`Krita` while painting,"
" just like having an organised artist's workplace can really speed up the"
" painting process in real life."

msgid ""
"RAM, or Random Access Memory, is the memory your computer is immediately "
"using. The difference between RAM and the hard drive memory can be "
"compared to the difference between having files on your desk and having "
"files safely stored away in an archiving room: The files on your desk as "
"much easier to access than the ones in your archive, and it takes time to"
" pull new files from the archive. This is the same for you computer and "
"RAM. Files need to be loaded into RAM before the computer can really use "
"them, and storing and removing them from RAM takes time."

"These settings allow you to choose how much of your virtual desk you "

"This is the maximum space :program:`Krita` will reserve on your RAM on "

" precisely. :program:`Krita` will not take up more space than this, "

"background."

msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/preferences/performance_settings.rst:31
msgid ""
"A feature for advanced computer users. This allows :program:`Krita` to "
"organise the area it takes up on the virtual working desk before putting "
"it's data on there. Like how a painter has a standard spot for their "
"canvas, :program:`Krita` also benefits from giving certain data it uses "
"it's place(a memory pool), so that it can find them easily, and it "
"doesn't get lost amongst the other data(memory fragmentation). It will "
"then also not have to spent time finding a spot for this data. Increasing"
" this of course means there's more space for this type of data, but like "
"how filling up your working desk with only one big canvas will make it "
"difficult to find room for your paints and brushes, having a large "
"internal pool will result in :program:`Krita` not knowing where to put "
"the other non-specific data. On the opposite end, not giving your canvas "
"a spot at all, will result in you spending more time looking for a place "
"where you will put the new layer or that reference you just took out of "
"the storage. This happens for :program:`Krita` as well, making it slower."
" This is recommended to be a size of one layer of your image, e.g. if you"
" usually paint on the image of 3000x3000x8bit-ARGB, the pool should be "
"something like 36 MiB. As :program:`Krita` does this on start-up, you "
"will need to restart :program:`Krita` to have this change affect "
"anything."

msgid ""
":program:`Krita` also needs to keep all the Undo states on the virtual "
"desk(RAM). Swapping means that parts of the files on the virtual desk get"
" sent to the virtual archive room. This allows :program:`Krita` to "
"dedicate more RAM space to new actions, by sending old Undo states to the"
" archive room once it hits this limit. This will make undoing a little "
"slower, but this can be desirable for the performance of :program:`Krita`"
" overall. This too needs :program:`Krita` to be restarted."
