"much lesser extent. The \"strength\" of the effect remains more or less "

"length of the effect is also affected. * Both Smearing and Dulling have a"

"Many of the included color smudge brush presets produce a thick oil "
"paint-like effect. This is mainly achieved with the Smearing mode on. "
"Basically: * Smearing mode with high smudge and color rates ** Both at "
"0.50 are fine for normal round brushes or fully opaque predefined brushes"
" ** Up to 1.00 each for brushes with less density or non fully-opaque "
"predefined brushes"

msgid ""
"When I say \"digital watercolor\", it refers to a style often seen "

"watercolor. For this you mostly need the Dulling mode. A few things: * "
"Contrary to the Smearing mode, you may want to lower opacity for normal "
"round brushes to get a smoother effect, to 0.70 for example. * Vary the "
"brush tip fade value as well. * When using Scatter or other dynamics, you"
" can choose to set smudge and color values to high or low values, for "
"different outcomes."
