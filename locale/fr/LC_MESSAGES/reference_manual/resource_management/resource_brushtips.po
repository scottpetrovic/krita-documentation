"For some time Photoshop has been using the ABR format to compile brushes "
"into a single file.  Krita can read and load .ABR files, although there "
"are certain features. For this example we will use an example of an .ABR "
"file that contains numerous images of types of trees and ferns.  We have "
"two objectives.  The first is to create a series of brushes that we an "
"quickly access from the Brush Presets dock to easily put together a "
"believable forest.  The second is to create a single brush that we can  "
"change on the fly to use for a variety of flora, without the need to have"
" a dedicated Brush Preset for each type."

"It's time now to create the Brush Preview graphic.  The simplest and "

"ScratchPad using the \"Reset\" button.  Now, center your cursor in the "
"Brush Preview square at the top of the ScratchPad and click once.  You "
"should see an image of your texture (in this case it would be the "
"evergreen tree.  In order to work correctly though the entire image "
"should fit comfortably within the square.  This might mean that you have "
"to tweak the size of the brush.  Once you have something you are happy "
