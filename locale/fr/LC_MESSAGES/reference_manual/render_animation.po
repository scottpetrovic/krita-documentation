"For rendering to an animated fileformat, Krita will first render to a png"
" sequence and then use FFMpeg, which is really good at encoding into "
"video files, to render that sequence to an animated fileformat. The "
"reason for this two-step process is that animation files can be really "
"complex and really big, and this is the best way to allow you to keep "
"control over the export process. For example, if your computer has a "
"hiccup, and one frame saves out weird, first saving the image sequence "
"allows you to only resave that one weird frame before rendering."

"This means that you will need to find a good place to stick your frames "
