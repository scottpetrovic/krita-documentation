"Krita's main goal is to help artists create digital painting from "
"scratch. Krita is used by comic artists, matte painters, texture artists,"
" and illustrators around the world. This section explains some common "
"workflow that artists use in Krita. When you open a new document in Krita"
" for the first time, you can start painting instantly. The brush tool is "
"selected by default and you just have to paint on the canvas. However, "
"let us look at what artists do in Krita. Below are some of the common "
"workflows used in Krita:"

"Some artists work only on digital medium, sketching and visualizing "
"concepts in Krita from scratch. As the name suggests a technique of "
"painting done within matter of hours to quickly visualize the basic scene"
" , character, look and feel of the environment or to denote the general "
"mood and overall concept is called a **speed painting**. Finishing and "
"finer details are not the main goal of this type of painting, but the "
"representation of form value and layout is main goal."

"Some artists set time limit to complete the painting while some paint "
"casually. Speed painting then can be taken forward by adding finer "
"details and polish to create a final piece. Generally artists first block"
" in the composition by adding patches and blobs of flat colors, defining "
"the silhouette etc . Krita has some efficient brushes for this situation,"
" for example the brush under **Block Tag** like Block fuzzy, Block basic,"
" layout_block etc."

"After the composition and a basic layout has been laid out the artists "
"add as much details as possible in the given limited time, this requires "

"objects. Below is an example of speed paint done by `David Revoy "
