"The first thing to realise about inking is that unlike anatomy, "
"perspective, composition or color theory, you cannot compensate for lack "
"of practice with study or reasoning. This is because all the magic in "
"drawing lines happens from your shoulder to your fingers, very little of "
"it happens in your head, and your lines improve with practice."

"On the other hand, this can be a blessing. You don’t need to worry about "
"whether you are smart enough, or are creative enough to be a good inker. "

"Generally, the lower down the arm the easier it is to make precise "

"tend to start off using our fingers and wrist a lot during drawing, "
"because it’s easier to be precise this way. But it’s difficult to make "
"long strokes, and furthermore, your fingers and wrist get tired far "

"Your shoulders and elbows on the other hand are actually quite good at "
"handling stress, and if you use your whole hand you will be able to make "
"long strokes far more easily. People who do calligraphy need shoulder "
"based strokes to make those lovely flourishes (personally, I can "
"recommend improving your handwriting as a way to improve inking), and "
"train their arms so they can do both big and small strokes with the full "

"To control pressure in this state effectively, you should press your "

"should then be put by your elbow."

"Not really. To both, actually. Inkers have had a real-life tool that made"
" it easier to ink, it’s called a rigger-brush, which is a brush with a "
"very long hairs. Due this length it sorta smooths out shakiness, and thus"

#: ../../tutorials/inking.rst:62
msgid ""
"On the other hand, doing too much smoothing during the whole drawing can "
"make your strokes very mechanical in the worst way. Having no jitter or "

msgstr ""

"Therefore, it’s wise to train your inking hand, yet not to be too hard on"
" yourself and refuse to use smoothing at all, as we all get tired, cold "

"In digital painting, we don’t have the luxury of being able to use two "

msgid ""
"A starting inker might be inclined to always want to use anti-aliased "
"brushes, after all, they look so smooth on the screen. However, while "
"these look good on screen, they might become fuzzy when printing them. "
"Therefore, Krita comes with two default types. Anti-aliased brushes like "
"ink_brush_25 and slightly aliased brushes like ink_tilt, with the latter "
"giving better print results. If you are trying to prepare for both, it "
"might be an idea to consider making the inking page 600dpi and the color "
"page 300dpi, so that the inking page has a higher resolution and the "
"‘jaggies’ aren’t as visible. You can turn any pixel brush into an aliased"
" brush, by going :kbd:`f5` and ticking **Sharpness**."

msgid ""
"Do you make smooth ‘wet’ strokes? Or do you make textured ones? For the "
"longest time, smooth strokes were preferred, as that would be less of a "
"headache when entering the coloring phase. Within Krita there’s several "
"methods to color these easily, the colorize mask being the prime example,"
" so textured becomes a viable option even for the lazy amongst us."
