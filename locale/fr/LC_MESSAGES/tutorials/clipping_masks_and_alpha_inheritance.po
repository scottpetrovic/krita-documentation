"Krita doesn't have clipping mask functionality in the manner that "
"Photoshop and programs that mimic Photoshop's functionality have. That's "
"because in Krita, unlike such software, a group layer is not an arbitrary"
" collection of layers. Rather, in Krita, group layers are composited "
"separately from the rest of the stack, and then the result is added into "
"the stack. In other words, in Krita group layers are in effect a separate"
" image inside your image."

"Here we have an image with line art and a layer for each flat of colors. "
"We want to add complicated multi-layered shading to this, while keeping "
"the neatness of the existing color flats. To get a clipping mask working,"
" you first need to put layers into a group. You can do this by making a "
"group layer and drag-and-dropping the layers into it, or by selecting the"
" layers you want grouped and pressing :kbd:`Ctrl+G`. Here we do that with"
" the iris and the eye-white layers."

"Now there’s an easier way to set up alpha inheritance. If you select a "

"with alpha inheritance is added on top."

"The fact that alpha inheritance can use the composited transparency from "
