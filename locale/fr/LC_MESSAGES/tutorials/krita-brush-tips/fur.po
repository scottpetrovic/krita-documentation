"`However, you can make a brush a little easier by using the Gradient, Mix"
" and HSV options in the pixel and color smudge brushes "
"<https://docs.krita.org/Pixel>`_. Basically, what we want to do is have a"
" stroke start dark and then become lighter as we draw with it, to "
"simulate how hair-tips catch more light and look lighter due to being "
"thinner at the ends, while at the base they are frequently more dark."

"Take the ink_brush_25 and choose under Brush-tip->predefined “A-2 dirty "
"brush”. Set the spacing to ‘auto’ and rightclick the spacing bar to type "
"in a value between 0.25 and 0.8. Also turn on the ‘enable pen-settings’ "
"on flow. Replicate the pressure curve above on the size option. We don’t "
"want the hairs to collapse to a point, hence why the curve starts so "
"high."

"Then activate value and reproduct this curve with the ‘distance’ or "
"‘fade’ sensor. Like how the pressure sensor changes a value(like size) "
"with the amount of pressure you put on the stylus, the distance sensor "
"measures how many pixels your stroke is, and can change an option "
"depending on that. For the HSV sensors: If the curve goes beneath the "
"middle, it’ll become remove from that adjustment, and above the vertical "
"middle it’ll add to that adjustment. So in this case, for the first 100px"
" the brush dab will go from a darkened version of the active paint color,"
" to the active paint color, and then for 100px+ it’ll go from the active "
"color to a lightened version. The curve is an inverse S-curve, because we"
" want to give a lot of room to the mid-tones."

"We do the same thing for saturation, so that the darkened color is also "
