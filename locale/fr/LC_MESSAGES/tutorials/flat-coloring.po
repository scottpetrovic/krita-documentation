"So you've got a cool black on white drawing, and now you want to color "
"it! The thing we’ll aim for in this tutorial is to get your lineart "
"colored in with flat colors. So no shading just yet. We’ll be going "
"through some techniques for preparing the lineart, and we’ll be using the"
" layer docker to put each colour on a separate layer, so we can easily "
"access each colour when we add shading."

"In programming, if you tell a computer to draw a red circle, and then "

"This is referred to as the “drawing order”. So like the traditional "
"artist, the computer will first draw the images that are behind "
"everything, and layer the subject and foreground on top of it. The layer "
"docker is a way for you to control the drawing order of multiple images, "
"so for example, you can have your lineart drawn later than your colors, "
"meaning that the lines will be drawn over the colors, making it easier to"
" make it neat!"
