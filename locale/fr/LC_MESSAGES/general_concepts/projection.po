"The Perspective Projection tutorial is one of the Kickstarter 2015 "
"tutorial rewards. It's about something that humanity has known "
"scientifically for a very long time, and decent formal training will "
"teach you about this. But I think there's very very few tutorials about "
"it in regard to how to achieve it in digital painting programs, let alone"
" open source."

"The tutorial is a bit image heavy, and technical, but I hope the skill it"
" teaches will be really useful to anyone trying to get a grasp on a "
"complicated pose. Enjoy, and don't forget to thank `Raghukamath "
"<http://www.raghukamath.com/>`_ for choosing this topic!"
