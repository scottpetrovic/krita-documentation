"So, if computers can already automate a ton, and it is fairly "
"complicated, is there still a use for a traditional 2d artist to learn "
"this?"

"Yes, actually. The benefit that 2d art still has over 3d is that it's "
"plain faster for single images, especially with complicated subjects like"
" faces and bodies."

"Perspective projection can help a lot getting down those annoying poses, "
"like people lying down. It also helps when combining 2d and 3d, as when "
"you know where the camera is in the 3d render, you can use that in a "
"projection to get the character projected."

"The side view of a person lying down is often easy to draw, but the top "
"view or the view from the feet isn’t. Hence why we use the side view to "
"do perspective projection on."

"Now, with this one we have a second vanishing point above the front-view."
" It should be about the same distance above the front-view as it is above"
" the head of the rotated side-view. The projection plane should also be "
"the same distance from the vanishing point, but that doesn’t mean it has "
"to be behind. This is something I avoided in the earlier examples, "
"because it makes the working field really messy, but if you look up "
"perspective projection you’ll see multiple examples of this method."

"Also of note is that you actually should be having the view "
"plane/projection plane perfectly perpendicular to the angle of the focal "
"point, otherwise you get odd distortion, this doesn’t happen here, which "
"means this sitting person is a bit more stretched vertically than "
"necessary."

"Here you can see that the the misalignment of the vanishing point to the "
"projection plane causes skewing which was then fixed by Krita’s transform"

"I probably didn’t make as nice result images as I could have, especially "
"if you compare it to the 3d images. However, you can still see that the "
"main landmarks are there. The real use of this technique lies in poses "
