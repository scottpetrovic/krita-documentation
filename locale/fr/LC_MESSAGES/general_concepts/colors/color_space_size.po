"For exchanging between programs and devices: most CMYK profiles are a "
"little bigger than our default sRGB in places, while in other places, "
"it's smaller. To get the best conversion, having your image in a space "
"that encompasses both you screen profile as your printer profile."

"On the left we have an artefact-ridden color managed jpeg file with an "
"ACES sRGBtrc v2 profile attached(or not, depending on mediawiki's mood, "
"if not then you can see the exact different between the colors more "
"clearly). This should give an approximation of the actual colors. On the "
"right, we have a sRGB png that was converted in Krita from the base file."

"Each of the gradients are gradients from the max of a given channel. As "
"you can see, the mid-tone of the ACES color space is much brighter than "
"the mid-tone of the RGB colorspace, and this is because the primaries are"
" further apart."

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_space_size.rst:44
msgid ""
"What this means for us is that when we start mixing or applying filters, "
"Krita can output values higher than visible, but also generate more "
"correct mixes and gradients. In particular, when color correcting, the "
"bigger space can help with giving more precise information."

"Bigger spaces do have the downside they require more precision if you do "
