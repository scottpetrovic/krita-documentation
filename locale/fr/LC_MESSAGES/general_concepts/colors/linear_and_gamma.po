"Now, the situation we talk about when talking theory is what we would "
"call 'linear'. Each step of brightness is the same value. Our eyes do not"
" perceive linearly. Rather, we find it more easy to distinguish between "
"darker greys than we do between lighter greys."

"As humans are the ones using computers, we have made it so that computers"
" will give more room to darker values in the coordinate system of the "
"image. We call this 'gamma-encoding', because it is applying a gamma "
"function to the TRC or transfer function of an image. The TRC in this "
"case being the Tone Response Curve or Tone Reproduction Curve or Transfer"
" function(because color management specialists hate themselves), which "
"tells your computer or printer how much color corresponds to a certain "
"value."

"If you look at linear of rec 709 TRCs, you can see there's quite a jump "

" Lab L* TRC or the sRGB TRC, which seem more evenly spaced. This is due "
"to our eyes' sensitivity to darker values. This also means that if you do"
" not have enough bit depth, an image in a linear space will look as if it"
" has ugly banding. Hence why, when we make images for viewing on a "
