"Much like physical media, there are many ways to mix colors together in "
"Krita. Traditional painters and illustrators often use techniques like "
"**glazing**, **scumbling**, and **hatching** to mix colors directly on "
"their canvas, on top of mixing colors together on a **palette** or even "
"within the hairs of their **brush**. With a little bit of practice and "
"know-how, and thanks to the variety of powerful tools in Krita, we can "
"mimic all of these mixing techniques in digital painting."

"On-canvas mixing techniques are ones where multiple colors are combined "
"directly on the canvas as the artist paints. This takes a few forms, "
"including **layering semi-transparent color** on top of another color, "
"using **texture** to change how a color is perceived, or even in the "
"interaction between two areas of wet paint in traditional media. Bottom "
"line: on-canvas mixing happens right on the canvas and is a great tool "
"for artistic exploration and \"happy accidents\"."

"In traditional painting, **glazing** is overlaying many different semi-"
"transparent layers to create on-canvas color mixtures. Likewise, in "
"digital painting we can also use glazing to mix colors directly on our "
"canvas. This is one of the most fundamental and commonly used mixing "
"techniques in digital painting."

"We first lay down a semi-transparent layer on top of another color that "
"we intend to mix with. Then, we pick the **resultant color** with "
":kbd:`ctrl` + |mouseleft| (this can be configured in the canvas input "
"settings), and paint with that. Depending on our brush's **opacity "
"setting**, each time we glaze one color over another we will get a color "
"that is somewhere between those two colors, often leading to a nice "
"mixture."

"We can mix even more easily with glazing when we set our brush's **flow**"

"<option_opacity_n_flow>` is transparency per dab instead of stroke, and "

"**Off-canvas** mixing has basically always been a core tool for artists "

"someone with a few **brushes** in one hand and a wooden **palette** in "
"the other. Whether it's oils, watercolor, or other traditional media, for"
" the artist to have absolute control over their colors it's crucial to "
"have some kind of palette, plate, jar, or other **off-canvas area** to "
"mix colors together. While it's easy to overlook this in digital painting"
" (where selecting fresh new colors without mixing at all is both easy and"
" free*), Krita has a few very useful and unique features for off-canvas "

"Krita, like almost every art and graphics program, has a "
":ref:`color_picker_tool` which allows you to very quickly sample a color "
"from any pixel on your canvas. While this tool may seem relatively simple"
" and humble, it is also one of the most important and commonly used tools"
" in the digital artist's toolbox - perhaps only second to the brush! In "
"fact, the color picker tool is at the very heart of mixing colors, and is"
" often used in combination with on-canvas techniques like glazing and "
"scumbling to produce smooth blends of color."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And still, there is more to this little tool than meets the eye! Not only"
" can you configure Krita's color picker to sample from the average color "
"of a **radius** of pixels, Krita's Color Picker also has a unique "
"**blending** feature: a powerful and intuitive tool for off-canvas color "
"mixing!"

"The Color Picker Blending feature changes the way that picking colors has"
" traditionally worked for decades; instead of completely replacing your "
"current brush color with the newly sampled color, *blending allows you to"
" quickly \"soak up\" some portion of the sampled color*, which is then "
"mixed with your current brush color."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:119
msgid ""
"You can use Color Picker Blending much like a physical paint brush in "
"traditional media. If you were to dip your paint brush into a pool of "
"*blue* paint, and then immediately dip again into a pool of *red* paint "
"and paint a stoke across your canvas, the stoke wouldn't be pure red - it"
" would be some combination of blue and red which would mix to create an "
"intermediate purple color. Which shade of purple would depend on the "
"ratio of paints that mix together within the hairs of your brush, and "
"this is essentially what the Color Picker's \"blend\" option controls: "
"what percentage of sampled color is mixed together with your current "
"brush color!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:121
msgid ""
"Not only does Krita's Color Picker Blending feel even more like mixing "
"paints, it is also completely off-canvas and independent of opacity, "
"flow, shape, and other brush settings. Furthermore, unlike most on-canvas"
" mixing techniques, Color Picker Blending works regardless of the "
"location of colors on your canvas - enabling your to mix with colors at "
"any position, on any layer, or even in different documents! Quickly mix "
"lighting colors with local colors, mix the ambient sky color into "
"shadows, create atmospheric depth, mix from a preselected palette of "
"colors in another layer/document, etc."

msgid ""
"To use Color Picker Blending, simply set the \"blend\" option in the "
"**Tool Options Docker** while the Color Picker Tool is active; setting "
"blend to 100% will cause your Color Picker to work in the traditional way"
" (completely replacing your brush color with the picked color), setting "
"to around 50% will give you a half-way mix between colors, and setting to"
" a lower value will create more subtle shifts in colors each click. Of "
"course, blending affects both your dedicated Color Picker Tool as well as"
" the :kbd:`ctrl +` |mouseleft| shortcut."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:127
msgid ""
"Clicking and dragging the Color Picker around the canvas currently causes"
" it to sample many times as it switches pixels. You can use this trait to"
" quickly soak up more color by \"dipping\" your color picker into a color"
" and swirling it around. This can be pretty satisfying! However, this "
"also means that some care must be taken to prevent from accidentally "
"picking up more color than you want. It's pretty easy to click a single "
"pixel only one time using a **mouse**, but when painting with a **drawing"
" tablet and pen** it can sometimes be desirable to use a slightly lower "
"blend setting!"

"**Q*:** \"What a waste of time! This is digital painting! Why should I "

msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:145
msgid ""
"**A:** There's some truth to this; traditional painters often have a "
"starting palette that's limited by the tubes/pans of paints that they "
"own, which is further limited by availability and cost of paint. For "
"digital painters, on the other hand, it's quick, easy, and totally free "
"to click on Krita's **Advanced Color Selector** to pull up any color in "
"your current color space. So why mix at all?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:147
msgid ""
"Well... Because working within a limited palette and mixing almost always"
" gives you *\"better colors\"*! Don't get me wrong - it's not that one "
"color is inherently and objectively better than another. While there is "
"certainly a time and place for bright and vivid illustration styles with "
"lots of strong and saturated colors, mixing from a more limited palette "
"results in *colors with depth, subtlety, and harmony* and helps artists "
"to achieve a **color scheme**. Not only does painting with a color scheme"
" help to get rid of dreaded \"choice paralysis\", it also sometimes helps"
" to imbue your artwork with the sense of *emotion and intentionality* "
"that we often admire in other great works of art."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:149
msgid ""
"So, next time you need to paint some *gray*, instead of reaching for a "
"random or generic gray from the Advanced Color Selector, consider using "
"one of Krita's many wonderful mixing tools to *create an interesting and "
"fitting gray* from hues that are roughly **complementary** (opposite each"
" other on the color wheel)."
msgstr ""

"While on-canvas and off-canvas techniques are fundamentally different "
"categories of mixing colors, they are **not** mutually exclusive at all! "
"All of the mixing methods in this article have pros and cons; different "
"tools can be useful for different situations, and combining various "
"techniques can be extremely powerful and fun!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_mixing.rst:157
msgid ""
"Finally, mixing colors will often go far better in a :ref:`higher bit-"
"depth like 16bit <bit_depth>`, though it'll make the image take up much "
"more working **memory** (RAM). Furthermore, using a :ref:`linear color "
"space <linear_and_gamma>` can often give far better mixtures than a "
"**gamma-corrected** one, though doing sketches and line art is easier to "
"do in a gamma-corrected space."
