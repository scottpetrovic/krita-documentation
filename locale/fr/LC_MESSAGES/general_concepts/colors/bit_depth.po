"One step up from 8bit, 16bit per channel allows for colors that can't be "

"Similar to 16bit, but with more range and less precision. Where 16bit "

"[0.15, 0.70, 0.3759], with [1.0,1.0,1.0] representing white. Because of "
"the differences between floating point and integer type variables, and "
"because Scene-referred imaging allows for negative values, you have about"
" 10-11bits of precision per channel in 16 bit floating point compared to "
"16 bit in 16 bit int(This is 2048 values per channel in the 0-1 range) "

"similar to 16bit float but with even higher precision. The native color "
"depth of OpenColor IO, and thus faster than 16bit float in HDR images, if"
" not heavier. Because of the nature of floating point type variables, "
"32bit float is roughly equal to 23-24 bits of precision per "
"channel(16777216 values per channel in the 0-1 range), but with a much "
"wider range(it can go far above 1), necessary for HDR/Scene-referred "

"And while you can attempt to create all your images a 32bit float, this "
