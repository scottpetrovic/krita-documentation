"So, usually what we mean by viewing conditions is the lighting and "
"decoration of the room that you are viewing the image in. Our eyes try to"
" make sense of both the colors that you are looking at actively(the "
"colors of the image) and the colors you aren't looking at actively(the "
"colors of the room), which means that both sets of colors affect how the "
"image looks."

"**Left**: Let's ruin Vermeer by putting a bright purple background that "
"asks for more attention than the famous painting it self. **Center**: a "
"much more neutral backdrop that an interior decorator would hate but "
"brings out the colors. **Right**: The approximate color that this "
"painting is displayed against in real life in the Maurits House, at the "
"least, last time I was there. Original image from wikipedia commons."

"This is for example, the reason why museum exhibitioners can get really "
"angry at the interior decorators when the walls of the museum are painted"
" bright red or blue, because this will drastically change the way how the"
" painting's colors look. (Which, if we are talking about a painter known "
"for their colors like Vermeer, could result in a really bad experience)."

"Lighting is the other component of the viewing condition which can have "
"dramatic effects. Lighting in particular affects the way how all colors "
"look. For example, if you were to paint an image of sunflowers and "
"poppies, print that out, and shine a bright yellow light on it, the "
"sunflowers would become indistinguishable from the white background, and "
"the poppies would look orange. This is called "
"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_%28color%29 metamerism], and "
"it's generally something you want to avoid in your color management "
"pipeline."

"For example, if you are designing a print for a red t-shirt that's not "
"bright red, but not super greyish red either. And you want to make sure "
"the colors of the print match the color of the t-shirt, so you make a "
"dummy background layer that is approximately that red, as correctly as "
"you can observe it, and paint on layers above that dummy layer. When you "
"are done, you hide this dummy layer and sent the image with a transparent"
" background to the press."

"You probably observed the t-shirt in a white room where there were "
"incandescent lamps shining, because as a true artist, you started your "
"work in the middle of the night, as that is when the best art is made. "
"However, incandescent lamps have a black body temperature of roughly "
"2300-2800K, which makes them give a yellowish light, officially called "
"White Point A."

"So, by eye-balling your t-shirt's color during the evening, you took it's"
" red color as transformed by the yellowish light. Had you made your "
"observation in diffuse sunlight of an overcast(which is also roughly "
"D65), or made it in direct sunlight light and painted your picture with a"
" profile set to D50, the color would have been much closer, and thus your"
" design would not be as yellowish."

"Applying a white balance filter will sort of match the colors to the tone"

"Now, you could technically quickly fix this by using a white balancing "

"However, when we start projecting, the lights of the room aren't dimmed, "
"which means that the tone scale of the colors becomes crunched, and "
"yellow becomes near indistinguishable from white. Furthermore, because "
"the light in the room is slightly yellowish, the purple is transformed "
"into red, making it indistinguishable from the red. Meaning that the "
"graphic is difficult to read."

"In both cases, you can use Krita's color management a little to help you,"

"That said, unless you have a display profile that uses LUTs, such as an "
"OCIO lut or a cLUT icc profile, white point won't matter much when "
"choosing a working space, due to weirdness in the icc v4 workflow which "
"always converts matrix profiles with relative colorimetric, meaning the "
"white points are matched up."
