"Choosing the right workspace profile to use depends on how much colors "
"you need and on the bit depth you plan to use. Imagine a line with the "
"whole color spectrum from pure black (0,0,0) to pure blue (0,0,1) in a "
"pure XYZ color cube. If you divide it choosing steps at a regular "
"interval, you get what is called a linear profile, with a gamma=1 curve "
"represented as a straight line from 0 to 1. With 8bit/channel bit depth, "
"we have only 256 values to store this whole line. If we use a linear "
"profile as described above to define those color values, we will miss "
"some important visible color change steps and have a big number of values"
" looking the same (leading to posterization effect)."

"This is why was created the sRGB profile to fit more different colors in "
"this limited amount of values, in a perceptually regular grading, by "
"applying a custom gamma curve (see picture here: "
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) to emulate the standard response curve"
" of old CRT screens. So sRGB profile is optimized to fit all colors that "
"most common screen can reproduce in those 256 values per R/G/B channels. "
"Some other profiles like Adobe RGB are optimized to fit more printable "
"colors in this limited range, primarily extending cyan-green hues. "
"Working with such profile can be useful to improve print results, but is "
"dangerous if not used with a properly profiled and/or calibrated good "
"display. Most common CMYK workspace profile can usually fit all their "
"colors within 8bit/channel depth, but they are all so different and "
"specific that it's usually better to work with a regular RGB workspace "
"first and then convert the output to the appropriate CMYK profile."

"Starting with 16bit/channel, we already have 65536 values instead of 256,"
" so we can use workspace profiles with higher gamut range like Wide-gamut"

"But sRGB being a generic profile (even more as it comes from old CRT "
"specifications..) , there is big chances that your monitor have actually "
"a different color response curve, and so color profile. So when you are "
"using sRGB workspace and have a proper screen profile loaded (see next "
"point), Krita knows that the colors the file contains are within the sRGB"
" color space, and converts those sRGB values to corresponding color "
"values from your monitor profile to display the canvas."
