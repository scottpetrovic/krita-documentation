".ora, or the Open Raster format, is an interchange format. It was "
"designed to replace :ref:`file_psd` as an interchange format, as the "
"latter isn't meant for that. Like :ref:`file_kra` it is loosely based on "
"the Open Document structure, thus a zip file with a bunch of xmls and "
"pngs, but where Krita's internal fileformat can sometimes have fully "
"binary chunks, .ora saves it's layers as :ref:`file_png` making it fully "
"open and easy to support."
