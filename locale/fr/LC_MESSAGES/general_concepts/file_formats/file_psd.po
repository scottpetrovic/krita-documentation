".psd is Photoshop's internal file format. For some reason, people like to"
" use it as an interchange format, even though it is not designed for "
"this."

".psd, unlike actual interchange formats like :ref:`file_pdf`, "
":ref:`file_tif`, :ref:`file_exr`, :ref:`file_ora` and :ref:`file_svg` "
"doesn't have an official spec online. Which means that it needs to be "
"reverse engineered. Furthermore, as an internal file format, it doesn't "
"have much of a philosophy to it's structure, as it's only purpose is to "
"save what photoshop is busy with, or rather, what all the past versions "
"of photoshop have been busy with. This means that the inside of a psd "
"looks somewhat like photoshop's virtual brains, and psd is in general a "
"very disliked file-format."

"Due to .psd being used as an interchange format, this leads to confusion "
"amongst people using these programs, as to why not all programs support "
"opening these. Sometimes, you might even see users saying that a certain "
"program is terrible because it doesn't support opening psds properly. But"
" as psd is an internal file-format without online specs, it is impossible"
" to have any program outside it support it 100%."

"Krita supports loading and saving raster layers, blending modes, "
"layerstyles, layer groups, and transparency masks from psd. It will "
"likely never support vector and text layers, as these are just too "
"difficult to program properly."

"We recommend using any other file format instead of psd if possible, with"
" a strong preference towards :ref:`file_ora` or :ref:`file_tif`."

"As a working file format, psds can be expected to become very heavy and "
