".jpg, .jpeg or .jpeg2000 are a family of file-formats designed to encode "
"photographs."

"Photographs have the problem that they have a lot of little gradients, "
"which means that you cannot index the file like you can with "
":ref:`file_gif` and expect the result to look good. What jpeg instead "
"does is that it converts the file to a perceptual color space(:ref:`YCrCb"
" <model_ycrcb>`), and then compresses the channels that encode the "
"colors, while keeping the channel that holds information about the "
"relative lightness uncompressed. This works really well because human "
"eye-sight is not as sensitive to colorfulness as it is to relative "
"lightness."

"However, it does mean that jpeg should be used in certain cases. For "
"images with a lot of gradients, like full scale paintings, jpeg performs "
"better than :ref:`file_png` and :ref:`file_gif`."

"But for images with a lot of sharp contrasts, like text and comic book "
"styles, png is a much better choice despite a larger file size. For "
"grayscale images, png and gif will definitely be more efficient."
