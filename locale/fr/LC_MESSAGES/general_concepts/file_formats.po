"This category is for graphics file-formats. While most file-formats can "
"be looked up on wikipedia, this doesn't always explain what the format "
"can be used for and what it's strengths and weaknesses are."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:18
msgid ""
"In this category we try to describe these in a manner that can be read by"
" beginners."
msgstr ""

"Generally, there's the following features that people pay attention to in"
" regards to fileformats:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:23
msgid "Compression"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:25
msgid ""
"Compression is how the file-format tries to describe the image with as "
"little data as possible, so that the resulting file is as small as it can"
" get without losing quality."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:27
msgid ""
"What we generally see is that formats that are small on disk either lose "
"image quality, or require the computer to spent a lot of time thinking "
"about how the image should look."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:29
msgid ""
"Vector file-formats like ``svg`` are a typical example of the latter. "
"They are really small because the technology used to create them is based"
" on mathematics, so it only stores maths-variables and can achieve a very"
" high quality. The downside is that the computer needs to spend a lot of "
"time thinking on how it should look, and sometimes different programs "
"have different ways of interpreting the values. Furthermore, vector file-"
"formats imply vector graphics, which is a very different way of working "
"than Krita is specialised in."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:31
msgid ""
"Lossy file formats, like ``jpg`` or ``webp`` are an example of small on "
"disk, but lowering the quality, and are best used for very particular "
"types of images. Lossy thus means that the file format plays fast and "
"loose with describing your image to reduce filesize."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:33
msgid ""
"Non-lossy or lossless formats, like ``png``, ``gif`` or ``bmp`` are in "
"contrast, much heavier on disk, but much more likely to retain quality."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:35
msgid ""
"Then, there's proper working file formats like Krita's ``.kra``, Gimp's "
"``xcf``, Photoshop's ``psd``, but also interchange formats like ora and "
"exr. These are the heaviest on the hard-drive and often require special "
"programs to open them up, but on the other hand these are meant to keep "
"your working enviroment in tact, and keep all the layers and guides in "
"them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:38
msgid "Metadata"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:40
msgid ""
"Metadata is the ability of a fileformat to contain information outside of"
" the actual image contents. This can be human readable data, like the "
"date of creation, the name of the author, a description of the image, but"
" also computer readable data, like an icc-profile which tells the "
"computer about the qualities of how the colors inside the file should be "
"read."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:43
msgid "Openness"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:45
msgid ""
"This is a bit of an odd quality, but it's about how easy it to open or "
"recover the file, and how widely it's supported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:47
msgid ""
"Most internal fileformats, like PSD are completely closed, and it's "
"really difficult for human outsiders to recover the data inside without "
"opening photoshop. Other examples are camera raw files which have "
"different properties per camera manufacturer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:49
msgid ""
"SVG, as a vector fileformat, is on the other end of the spectrum, and can"
" be opened with any text-editor and edited."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats.rst:51
msgid ""
"Most formats are in-between, and thus there's also a matter of how widely"
" supported the format is. jpg and png cannot be read or edited by human "
"eyes, but the vast majority of programs can open them, meaning the owner "
"has easy access to them."
